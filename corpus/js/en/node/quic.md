<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The <code>quic</code> module is built around three core abstractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>QuicEndpoint</code>: represents the local UDP socket binding for QUIC. It is
used to send and receive QUIC packets and can be shared across multiple
sessions. A single endpoint can be used as both a client and a server
simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QuicSession</code>: represents a QUIC connection between the local endpoint and
a remote peer. A session is created either by initiating a connection to a
remote peer using <code>quic.connect()</code> or by accepting an incoming connection
from a remote peer via <code>quic.listen()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>QuicStream</code>: represents a QUIC stream within a session. Streams are
created by either local or remote peers and can be bidirectional or
unidirectional.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike traditional TCP-based protocols, QUIC &quot;connections&quot; are not inherently
tied to a specific local port / remote port pair. A session is initiated via
a QUIC endpoint but may be migrated to a different local or remote address
over its lifetime, outlive the endpoint that created it, and may even be
associated with multiple endpoints simultaneously. This flexibility allows for
advanced use cases such as connection migration, multi-homing, and load balancing.
Most often, however, a simple one-to-one relationship between endpoint and session
is sufficient.</p>
<h3>Integrated TLS 1.3</h3>
<p>The QUIC protocol integrates TLS 1.3 directly into the protocol for connection
establishment and security. The <code>quic</code> module's API reflects this integration
by exposing TLS-related information and configuration options. It is currently
not possible to use QUIC without TLS or to use a different version of TLS.</p>
<p>Every QUIC session starts with the client and server performing a TLS handshake
to negotiate the application protocol (via ALPN), authenticate the server (and
optionally the client), exchange transport parameters, and establish shared keys
for encryption.</p>
<h4>Certificate size and handshake performance</h4>
<p>QUIC includes an anti-amplification limit (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-8.1">RFC 9000 Section 8.1</a>) that
restricts the server to sending at most three times the data received from
the client before the client's address is validated. Because the client's
Initial packet is typically around 1200 bytes, the server can send at most
approximately 3600 bytes before it must wait for the client to acknowledge.</p>
<p>The server's initial response is dominated by its TLS certificate chain. If
the certificate chain exceeds the amplification limit, the handshake requires
an additional round trip — the server must pause, wait for the client's
acknowledgement, and then continue sending the remainder of the certificate.
This eliminates QUIC's 1-RTT handshake advantage over TCP+TLS and can add
50–100 ms or more of latency on the first connection, depending on the network
path.</p>
<p>To avoid this, servers should use compact certificate chains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use ECDSA certificates</strong> (P-256 or P-384) rather than RSA. ECDSA keys and
signatures are significantly smaller. A typical ECDSA P-256 certificate chain
with one intermediate is approximately 1.5–2 KB, well within the amplification
limit. An equivalent RSA-2048 chain is often 3–5 KB, which may exceed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize the certificate chain.</strong> Include only the leaf certificate and
the necessary intermediate(s). Do not include the root certificate (clients
already have it in their trust store). Avoid cross-signed intermediates when
the self-signed root is already widely trusted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prefer certificate authorities with short chains.</strong> Some CAs issue
certificates with a single small intermediate, while others require multiple
large RSA intermediates. The choice of CA directly affects handshake latency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Certificate compression (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8879">RFC 8879</a>) can also address this issue by
compressing the certificate chain during the handshake, often keeping the
server's Certificate message within the amplification limit and avoiding the
extra round trip. Certificate compression is opt-in via the
<a href="#sessionoptionscertificatecompression"><code>certificateCompression</code></a> TLS option and is disabled by default. When
enabled, it applies to both the server's certificate and, for mutual TLS,
the client's certificate.</p>
<h3>Rate limiting</h3>
<p>QUIC endpoints include built-in rate limiting to protect against
denial-of-service attacks. There are two layers of defense:</p>
<p><strong>Global rate limits</strong> cap the total rate of stateless responses that the
endpoint will send, regardless of the source address. These protect against
floods from spoofed source IP addresses, where an attacker rotates through
many fake source addresses to bypass per-host limits. Four types of stateless
responses are independently rate-limited:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retry packets</strong> — sent to validate a client's address during connection
setup. Configurable via <a href="#endpointoptionsretryrate"><code>endpointOptions.retryRate</code></a> and
<a href="#endpointoptionsretryburst"><code>endpointOptions.retryBurst</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless reset packets</strong> — sent when the endpoint receives a packet for an
unknown session. Configurable via <a href="#endpointoptionsstatelessresetrate"><code>endpointOptions.statelessResetRate</code></a>
and <a href="#endpointoptionsstatelessresetburst"><code>endpointOptions.statelessResetBurst</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Version negotiation packets</strong> — sent when a client uses an unsupported QUIC
version. Configurable via <a href="#endpointoptionsversionnegotiationrate"><code>endpointOptions.versionNegotiationRate</code></a> and
<a href="#endpointoptionsversionnegotiationburst"><code>endpointOptions.versionNegotiationBurst</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate connection close packets</strong> — sent when the server is busy or a
token is invalid. Configurable via <a href="#endpointoptionsimmediatecloserate"><code>endpointOptions.immediateCloseRate</code></a>
and <a href="#endpointoptionsimmediatecloseburst"><code>endpointOptions.immediateCloseBurst</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each rate limit uses a token bucket: the endpoint can send up to the burst
capacity instantly, and tokens refill at the configured rate per second. When
the bucket is empty, additional responses of that type are silently dropped.
The defaults (100 per second, burst of 200) are suitable for most deployments.</p>
<p><strong>Per-host session creation rate limits</strong> cap how fast a single remote address
can create new sessions. This is tracked per validated remote address and
prevents a single client from churning through sessions (rapidly connecting and
disconnecting) to consume server resources. Configurable via
<a href="#endpointoptionssessioncreationrate"><code>endpointOptions.sessionCreationRate</code></a> and
<a href="#endpointoptionssessioncreationburst"><code>endpointOptions.sessionCreationBurst</code></a>. The defaults (50 per second, burst
of 100) are generous enough for legitimate traffic patterns. For benchmarking
scenarios where traffic comes from a single source, increase these values.</p>
<p>In addition to rate limiting, the endpoint supports <strong>concurrent connection
limits</strong> via <code>maxConnectionsPerHost</code> and <code>maxConnectionsTotal</code>, and a
<strong>busy mode</strong> via <a href="#endpointbusy"><code>endpoint.busy</code></a> that rejects all new connections.</p>
<p>Rate limiting activity can be monitored through the endpoint's statistics
object. Each rate limiter has a corresponding counter
(e.g., <code>endpoint.stats.retryRateLimited</code>,
<code>endpoint.stats.sessionCreationRateLimited</code>) that tracks how many responses
were dropped. A non-zero value indicates the rate limiter is actively
protecting the endpoint.</p>
<h4>Block lists</h4>
<p>Endpoints can filter incoming packets by source address using a
<a href="net.md#class-netblocklist"><code>net.BlockList</code></a>. The block list is checked before any QUIC processing
occurs, so blocked packets consume no resources beyond the check itself.</p>
<p>In <strong>deny</strong> mode (the default), packets from addresses in the list are dropped:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { BlockList } from 'node:net';
import { listen } from 'node:quic';

const blocked = new BlockList();
blocked.addSubnet('192.168.1.0', 24);  // Block an entire subnet
blocked.addAddress('10.0.0.5');        // Block a specific address

const endpoint = await listen(onSession, {
  endpoint: {
    blockList: blocked,
    blockListPolicy: 'deny',
  },
  // ...
});
</code></pre>
<p>In <strong>allow</strong> mode, only packets from addresses in the list are accepted:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">const trusted = new BlockList();
trusted.addSubnet('10.0.0.0', 8);

const endpoint = await listen(onSession, {
  endpoint: {
    blockList: trusted,
    blockListPolicy: 'allow',
  },
  // ...
});
</code></pre>
<p>The block list is evaluated live — rules added or removed after the endpoint
is created take effect immediately. The <code>endpoint.stats.packetsBlocked</code>
counter tracks how many packets have been dropped by the filter.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>Every <code>QuicSession</code> is associated with a single application protocol, negotiated
via ALPN during the TLS handshake. The <code>quic</code> module is designed to be
application-agnostic in general but includes built-in support for HTTP/3 as a
specific application protocol. When using HTTP/3, the <code>quic</code> module provides
additional APIs for handling HTTP/3-specific features such as headers, trailers,
and prioritization. For other application protocols, users can implement their
own message framing and multiplexing on top of the core QUIC transport features.</p>
<p>When initiating a TLS handshake, the client will include a list of supported
ALPN protocols in the <code>ClientHello</code>. The server selects one of these protocols
(if any) and includes it in the <code>ServerHello</code>. The negotiated protocol determines
how the <code>QuicSession</code> and <code>QuicStream</code> APIs behave. For example, when the <code>h3</code>
protocol is negotiated for HTTP/3, the <code>QuicSession</code> and <code>QuicStream</code> will support
HTTP/3-specific features.</p>
<p>Currently, the <code>quic</code> module only supports HTTP/3 as a built-in application protocol.
All other protocols must be implemented by the user on top of the provided JavaScript
API.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The QUIC API is designed to be flexible and highly configurable to support a wide
range of use cases. Users can configure various aspects of the QUIC transport,
TLS handshake, and application behavior via options passed to the <code>quic.connect()</code>
and <code>quic.listen()</code> functions, as well as dynamically on <code>QuicEndpoint</code> and
<code>QuicSession</code> instances. The API also provides access to detailed statistics and
events for monitoring and debugging.</p>
<p>QUIC transport parameters are exchanged during the TLS handshake to negotiate
various transport-level settings such as maximum stream counts, idle timeouts,
and datagram support. The <code>quic</code> module allows users to configure the transport
parameters their endpoint advertises to peers, as well as access the transport
parameters advertised by peers. These configure the capabilities and limits of
the QUIC connection in coordination with the peer.</p>
<p>A rich set of local settings is also available for configuring the behavior of
the local endpoint and sessions. These include settings for connection limits,
congestion control, stream prioritization, and more.</p>
<h3>Callbacks and Promises</h3>
<p>The <code>quic</code> module uses a combination of callbacks and promises for asynchronous
operations. For example, initiating a connection with <code>quic.connect()</code> returns
a promise for the established session, while incoming sessions on the server
side are handled via a callback passed to <code>quic.listen()</code>. Within a session,
events such as incoming streams, datagrams, and session state changes are handled
via callbacks on the <code>QuicSession</code> instance. Promises are used for operations
that have a clear completion point, such as completion of the TLS handshake or
graceful closure of a session.</p>
<p>All callbacks are invoked synchronously and may either return synchronously or
return a promise. If a callback returns a promise that rejects, or throws an error,
the object will be destroyed with the error as the reason if an <code>onerror</code> callback
is not specified.</p>
<h3>Streams</h3>
<p>Streams are the primary data-carrying abstraction in QUIC. A stream can be
initiated by either the local endpoint or the remote peer once a session is
established.</p>
<p>Streams can be either bidirectional (data flows in both directions) or
unidirectional (data flows in only one direction). The <code>quic</code> module provides
separate APIs for creating each kind:
<a href="#sessioncreatebidirectionalstreamoptions"><code>session.createBidirectionalStream()</code></a> and
<a href="#sessioncreateunidirectionalstreamoptions"><code>session.createUnidirectionalStream()</code></a>. Streams initiated by a remote
peer are delivered via the <a href="#sessiononstream"><code>session.onstream</code></a> callback. When the
negotiated application protocol supports the stream-level callbacks (e.g.
HTTP/3) and an <code>onheaders</code> callback is configured, incoming streams can
instead be consumed entirely through it and registering <code>onstream</code> is
optional.</p>
<p>There are two ways to write data to a stream:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body source</strong> — pass a <code>body</code> option when creating the stream (or call
<a href="#streamsetbodybody"><code>stream.setBody()</code></a>). The body can be a string, <code>ArrayBuffer</code>,
<code>ArrayBufferView</code>, <code>Blob</code>, <code>FileHandle</code>, <code>AsyncIterable</code>, sync <code>Iterable</code>,
or <code>Promise</code> resolving to any of these. A <code>null</code> body closes the writable
side immediately. This is the simplest approach when the data is available
up front or can be expressed as an iterable.</li>
<li><strong>Writer</strong> — access <a href="#streamwriter"><code>stream.writer</code></a> to push data incrementally. The
writer exposes synchronous methods (<code>writeSync()</code>, <code>writevSync()</code>,
<code>endSync()</code>) that return immediately, as well as asynchronous counterparts
(<code>write()</code>, <code>writev()</code>, <code>end()</code>). The asynchronous <code>write()</code> and <code>writev()</code>
methods use the stream/iter strict backpressure policy: when the write buffer
is full, they reject with <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> instead of waiting for capacity.
If a drain is already pending, <code>end()</code> waits for it before closing. Check
<code>writer.canWrite</code> before writing. To wait for capacity, use <code>ondrain()</code> from
<code>node:stream/iter</code>, then retry the write. The stream's <code>onblocked</code> callback
reports that transport flow control has blocked progress, but does not
signal that writer capacity is available again.
<code>writeSync()</code> returns <code>false</code> when the write buffer is full; the caller
should wait with <code>ondrain()</code> before retrying.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two approaches are mutually exclusive for a given stream.</p>
<p>Reading is done by iterating the stream as an async iterable. Each iteration
yields a batch of <code>Uint8Array</code> chunks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">for await (const chunks of stream) {
  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    // Process each Uint8Array chunk
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Only one async iterator can be obtained per stream. The stream is also
compatible with <code>node:stream/iter</code> utilities such as <code>Stream.bytes()</code>,
<code>Stream.text()</code>, and <code>Stream.pipeTo()</code>.</p>
<h3>Datagrams</h3>
<p>In addition to streams, QUIC supports unreliable datagrams (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9221">RFC 9221</a>) for
use cases that require low-latency, best-effort messaging.</p>
<p>Datagram support is enabled at two levels. At the QUIC transport level, both
peers must advertise a non-zero <a href="#transportparamsmaxdatagramframesize"><code>maxDatagramFrameSize</code></a> transport parameter
during the handshake. For HTTP/3 sessions, both peers must additionally set
<a href="#sessionoptionsapplication"><code>application.enableDatagrams</code></a> to <code>true</code>, which exchanges the
<code>SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM</code> setting on the HTTP/3 control stream.</p>
<p>A datagram is sent with a single call to <a href="#sessionsenddatagramdatagram-encoding"><code>session.sendDatagram()</code></a>. Each
datagram must fit within a single QUIC packet — datagrams cannot be
fragmented. The maximum payload size is determined by the peer's
<code>maxDatagramFrameSize</code> and the path MTU. If a datagram is too large or the
peer does not support datagrams, <code>sendDatagram()</code> returns <code>0n</code> rather than
throwing an error.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee of delivery. Datagrams may be lost, duplicated, or
delivered out of order. The <a href="#sessionondatagramstatus"><code>session.ondatagramstatus</code></a> callback reports
whether each sent datagram was <code>'acknowledged'</code>, <code>'lost'</code>, or <code>'abandoned'</code>
(never sent on the wire).</p>
<h3>0-RTT early data and session resumption</h3>
<p>QUIC supports 0-RTT early data, allowing a client that has previously connected
to a server to send application data with its very first packet, without waiting
for the handshake to complete. This can eliminate a full round-trip of latency on
reconnection.</p>
<p>Two pieces of state from a prior connection make this possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>session ticket</strong>, received via the <a href="#sessiononsessionticket"><code>session.onsessionticket</code></a> callback,
enables TLS session resumption and 0-RTT encryption. Pass it as the
<a href="#sessionoptionssessionticket"><code>sessionOptions.sessionTicket</code></a> option on a subsequent connection to the
same server.</li>
<li>An <strong>address validation token</strong>, received via the <a href="#sessiononnewtoken"><code>session.onnewtoken</code></a>
callback, allows the client to skip the server's address validation step
(avoiding a Retry round-trip). Pass it as the <a href="#sessionoptionstoken-client-only"><code>sessionOptions.token</code></a>
option.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the server accepts the session ticket, any data sent before the handshake
completes is 0-RTT early data. On the server side, <code>stream.early</code> is <code>true</code>
for streams carrying early data. The server can reject the 0-RTT attempt
(for example, if its configuration has changed since the ticket was issued).
When this happens, all streams opened during the 0-RTT phase are destroyed and
the client's <a href="#sessiononearlyrejected"><code>session.onearlyrejected</code></a> callback fires. The connection
falls back to a normal 1-RTT handshake and the application can reopen streams.</p>
<p>Early data is less secure than data sent after the handshake completes — it
can potentially be replayed by an attacker. Applications should treat 0-RTT
data with appropriate caution and avoid performing non-idempotent operations
during the early data phase.</p>
<h3>Connection lifecycle</h3>
<p>A typical client session progresses through these stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call <a href="#quicconnectaddress-options"><code>quic.connect()</code></a> with a server address and options. This returns a
<code>QuicSession</code>.</li>
<li>The TLS handshake runs automatically. <code>session.opened</code> resolves when the
handshake completes, providing the negotiated ALPN, cipher, and certificate
validation results.</li>
<li>Open streams, send datagrams, and exchange data.</li>
<li>Call <a href="#sessioncloseoptions"><code>session.close()</code></a> to initiate a graceful shutdown. Existing streams
are allowed to finish, then the session is destroyed. The returned promise
(also available as <code>session.closed</code>) resolves when teardown is complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the server side, call <a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>quic.listen()</code></a> with a callback. The callback
fires for each incoming session after the TLS handshake begins. Incoming
streams arrive via the <a href="#sessiononstream"><code>session.onstream</code></a> callback, or, for HTTP/3
sessions with an <code>onheaders</code> callback configured, directly through that
callback (see the <a href="#minimal-http3-server">minimal HTTP/3 server</a> example).</p>
<p><a href="#sessiondestroyerror-options"><code>session.destroy()</code></a> is available for immediate teardown — all open streams
are destroyed and the session is closed without waiting for them to finish.</p>
<p><code>QuicEndpoint</code> and <code>QuicSession</code> support <code>Symbol.asyncDispose</code>, so they can
be used with <code>await using</code> for automatic cleanup.</p>
<h3>Error handling</h3>
<p>Errors in the <code>quic</code> module are communicated through two complementary
mechanisms: the <code>onerror</code> callback and the <code>closed</code> promise.</p>
<p>Both <code>QuicSession</code> and <code>QuicStream</code> expose an optional <code>onerror</code> callback.
When a session or stream is destroyed with an error — including errors thrown
by other user callbacks — the <code>onerror</code> callback is invoked with the error
before the object is torn down. Setting <code>onerror</code> also marks the <code>closed</code>
promise as handled, preventing unhandled rejection warnings. If <code>onerror</code>
is not set, the error is delivered solely through the rejection of the
<code>closed</code> promise.</p>
<p>The <a href="#class-quicerror"><code>QuicError</code></a> class carries an explicit numeric QUIC error code
(<a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a>) alongside the usual <code>message</code> and <code>code</code> properties.
When a <code>QuicError</code> is passed to <a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a> or
<a href="#streamwriter"><code>writer.fail()</code></a>, its <code>errorCode</code> is used in the <code>RESET_STREAM</code> or
<code>STOP_SENDING</code> frame sent to the peer. Any other error type falls back to
the negotiated protocol's generic internal error code.</p>
<h3>Permission model</h3>
<p>When using the <a href="permissions.md#permission-model">Permission Model</a>, the <code>--allow-net</code> flag must be passed to
allow QUIC network operations. Without it, calling <a href="#quicconnectaddress-options"><code>quic.connect()</code></a> or
<a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>quic.listen()</code></a> will throw an <code>ERR_ACCESS_DENIED</code> error.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ node --permission --allow-fs-read=* --experimental-quic index.mjs
Error: Access to this API has been restricted. Use --allow-net to manage permissions.
  code: 'ERR_ACCESS_DENIED',
  permission: 'Net',
}
</code></pre>
<p>Creating a <a href="#class-quicendpoint"><code>QuicEndpoint</code></a> instance without connecting or listening
is permitted even without <code>--allow-net</code>, since no network I/O occurs until
<a href="#quicconnectaddress-options"><code>quic.connect()</code></a> or <a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>quic.listen()</code></a> is called.</p>
<h2><code>quic.connect(address[, options])</code></h2>

<h3><code>session.onerror</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>An optional callback invoked when the session is destroyed with an error.
This includes errors caused by user callbacks that throw or reject (see
<a href="#callback-error-handling">Callback error handling</a>). The callback receives a single argument: the
error that triggered the destruction. If the <code>onerror</code> callback itself throws
or returns a promise that rejects, the error is surfaced as an uncaught
exception. Read/write.</p>
<p>Can also be set via the <code>onerror</code> option in <a href="#quicconnectaddress-options"><code>quic.connect()</code></a> or
<a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>quic.listen()</code></a>.</p>
<h3><code>session.onstream</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnStreamCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when a new stream is initiated by a remote peer. Read/write.</p>
<p>If no <code>onstream</code> callback is set and the stream has no other consumer, an
incoming stream is destroyed on arrival and a warning is emitted. An
<code>onheaders</code> callback counts as a consumer when the negotiated application
protocol supports it (e.g. HTTP/3), because it is invoked for every incoming
request stream. Other stream-level callbacks (<code>ontrailers</code>, <code>oninfo</code>,
<code>onwanttrailers</code>) do not, since they are conditional or outbound-only and
would leave the stream unobservable. An HTTP/3 server that handles requests
entirely through <code>onheaders</code> does not need to set <code>onstream</code>.</p>
<h3><code>session.ondatagram</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnDatagramCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when a new datagram is received from a remote peer. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.ondatagramstatus</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnDatagramStatusCallback}</li>

<p>The callback to invoke when the status of a datagram is updated. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.onearlyrejected</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the server rejects 0-RTT early data. When
this fires, all streams that were opened during the 0-RTT phase have
been destroyed. The application should re-open streams if needed.
Read/write.</p>
<p>This callback only fires on the client side when the server rejects
the client's 0-RTT attempt. The connection falls back to 1-RTT and
continues normally.</p>
<h3><code>session.onpathvalidation</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnPathValidationCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the path validation is updated. Read/write.</p>

<li>Type: {quic.OnVersionNegotiationCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when a version negotiation is initiated. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.onhandshake</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnHandshakeCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the TLS handshake is completed. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.onnewtoken</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnNewTokenCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when a NEW_TOKEN token is received from the server.
The token can be passed as the <code>token</code> option on a future connection to
the same server to skip address validation. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.onorigin</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnOriginCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when an ORIGIN frame (RFC 9412) is received from
the server, indicating which origins the server is authoritative for.
Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.ongoaway</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the peer sends an HTTP/3 GOAWAY frame,
indicating it is initiating a graceful shutdown. The callback receives
<code>(lastStreamId)</code> where <code>lastStreamId</code> is a <code>{bigint}</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>lastStreamId</code> is <code>-1n</code>, the peer sent a shutdown notice (intent
to close) without specifying a stream boundary. All existing streams
may still be processed.</li>
<li>When <code>lastStreamId</code> is <code>&gt;= 0n</code>, it is the highest stream ID the peer
may have processed. Streams with IDs above this value were NOT
processed and can be safely retried on a new connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>After GOAWAY is received, <code>session.createBidirectionalStream()</code> will
throw <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code>. Existing streams continue until they
complete or the session closes.</p>
<p>This callback is only relevant for HTTP/3 sessions. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>session.onkeylog</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnKeylogCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when TLS key material is available. Requires
<a href="#sessionoptionskeylog"><code>sessionOptions.keylog</code></a> to be <code>true</code>. Each invocation receives a single
line of <a href="https://udn.realityripple.com/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format">NSS Key Log Format</a> text (including a trailing newline). This is
useful for decrypting packet captures with tools like Wireshark. Read/write.</p>
<p>Can also be set via the <code>onkeylog</code> option in <a href="#quicconnectaddress-options"><code>quic.connect()</code></a> or
<a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>quic.listen()</code></a>.</p>
<h3><code>session.onqlog</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnQlogCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when qlog data is available. Requires
<a href="#sessionoptionsqlog"><code>sessionOptions.qlog</code></a> to be <code>true</code>. The callback receives a string
chunk of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7464">JSON-SEQ</a> formatted qlog data and a boolean <code>fin</code> flag. When
<code>fin</code> is <code>true</code>, the chunk is the final qlog output for this session and
the concatenated chunks form a complete qlog trace. Read/write.</p>
<p>Qlog data arrives during the connection lifecycle. The first chunk contains
the qlog header with format metadata. Subsequent chunks contain trace
events. The final chunk (with <code>fin</code> set to <code>true</code>) is emitted during
session destruction and completes the JSON-SEQ output.</p>
<p>Can also be set via the <code>onqlog</code> option in <a href="#quicconnectaddress-options"><code>quic.connect()</code></a> or
<a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>quic.listen()</code></a>.</p>

<p>If <code>datagram</code> is a string, it will be encoded using the specified <code>encoding</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>datagram</code> is an <code>ArrayBufferView</code>, the bytes are copied into an
internal buffer; the caller's source buffer is unchanged and may be reused
or mutated immediately after the call returns. Callers that want to ensure
their source cannot be mutated after the call (for example, when handing
the buffer off to another async consumer) can call
<code>ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer()</code> themselves before passing the buffer.</p>
<p>If <code>datagram</code> is a <code>Promise</code>, it will be awaited before sending. If the
session closes while awaiting, <code>0n</code> is returned silently (datagrams are
inherently unreliable).</p>
<p>If the datagram payload is zero-length (empty string after encoding, detached
buffer, or zero-length view), <code>0n</code> is returned and no datagram is sent.</p>
<p>For HTTP/3 sessions, the peer must advertise <code>SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM=1</code>
(via <code>application: { enableDatagrams: true }</code>) for datagrams to be sent.
If the peer's setting is <code>0</code>, <code>sendDatagram()</code> returns <code>0n</code> (per RFC 9297
§3, an endpoint MUST NOT send HTTP Datagrams unless the peer indicated
support).</p>
<p>Datagrams cannot be fragmented — each must fit within a single QUIC packet.
The maximum datagram size is determined by the peer's
<code>maxDatagramFrameSize</code> transport parameter (which the peer advertises during
the handshake). If the peer sets this to <code>0</code>, datagrams are not supported
and <code>0n</code> will be returned. If the datagram exceeds the peer's limit, it
will be silently dropped and <code>0n</code> returned. The local
<code>maxDatagramFrameSize</code> transport parameter (default: <code>1200</code> bytes) controls
what this endpoint advertises to the peer as its own maximum.</p>
<h3><code>session.servername</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string|boolean|null}</li>
</ul>
<p>The SNI (Server Name Indication) host name associated with the session. This is
<code>null</code> before the client hello is processed. Once the hello has been
processed, this is either the host name string or <code>false</code> if the handshake
had no SNI.</p>
<h3><code>session.alpnProtocol</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string|null}</li>
</ul>
<p>The negotiated ALPN protocol. This is <code>null</code> before the client hello is
processed. Once ALPN has been negotiated, this is the protocol string. ALPN
is mandatory in QUIC so this is never <code>false</code> on successful connections,
unlike <code>node:tls</code> where this is optional.</p>
<h3><code>session.certificate</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {crypto.X509Certificate|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>The local certificate as a <a href="crypto.md#class-x509certificate"><code>crypto.X509Certificate</code></a> instance. Server
sessions return the certificate configured for the negotiated SNI host.
Client sessions return <code>undefined</code> unless a client certificate was sent.
Returns <code>undefined</code> if the session is destroyed.</p>
<h3><code>session.peerCertificate</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {crypto.X509Certificate|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>The peer's certificate as a <a href="crypto.md#class-x509certificate"><code>crypto.X509Certificate</code></a> instance. Returns
<code>undefined</code> if the peer did not present a certificate or the session is
destroyed.</p>
<h3><code>session.ephemeralKeyInfo</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>The ephemeral key information for the session, with properties such as
<code>type</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>size</code>. Only available on client sessions. Returns
<code>undefined</code> for server sessions or if the session is destroyed.</p>
<h3><code>session.maxDatagramSize</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum datagram payload size in bytes that the peer will accept.
This is derived from the peer's <code>maxDatagramFrameSize</code> transport
parameter minus the DATAGRAM frame overhead (type byte and variable-length
integer encoding). Returns <code>0</code> if the peer does not support datagrams or
if the handshake has not yet completed. Datagrams larger than this value
will not be sent.</p>
<h3><code>session.maxPendingDatagrams</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>128</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of datagrams that can be queued for sending. Datagrams
are queued when <code>sendDatagram()</code> is called and sent opportunistically
alongside stream data by the packet serialization loop. When the queue
is full, the <a href="#sessionoptionsdatagramdroppolicy"><code>sessionOptions.datagramDropPolicy</code></a> determines whether
the oldest or newest datagram is dropped. Dropped datagrams are reported
as lost via the <code>ondatagramstatus</code> callback.</p>
<p>This property can be changed dynamically to adjust queue capacity
based on application activity or memory pressure. The valid range
is <code>0</code> to <code>65535</code>.</p>
<h3><code>session.stats</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.QuicSession.Stats}</li>
</ul>
<p>Return the current statistics for the session. Read only.</p>
<h3><code>session.updateKey()</code></h3>
<p>Initiate a key update for the session.</p>
<h3><code>session[Symbol.asyncDispose]()</code></h3>
<p>Calls <code>session.close()</code> and returns a promise that fulfills when the
session has closed.</p>

<h2>Class: <code>QuicError</code></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Stability: 1 - Experimental</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <code>QuicError</code> is an <code>Error</code> subclass that carries an explicit numeric
QUIC error code. Use it to abort a QUIC stream or session with a
specific application-protocol-defined error code rather than letting
the implementation pick a generic fallback.</p>
<p>The class is exported from <code>node:quic</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { QuicError } from 'node:quic';
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-cjs">const { QuicError } = require('node:quic');
</code></pre>
<p>When a <code>QuicError</code> is supplied to APIs that emit a wire frame
(<a href="#streamwriter"><code>writer.fail()</code></a>, <a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a>), the QUIC stack uses
<a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a> as the wire code for the resulting frame.
When any other value is supplied (for example a plain <code>Error</code>), the
implementation falls back to the negotiated application protocol's
&quot;internal error&quot; code (<code>H3_INTERNAL_ERROR</code> (<code>0x102</code>) for HTTP/3, or
the QUIC transport-layer <code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> (<code>0x1</code>) for raw QUIC).</p>
<p>The Node.js error code (<code>error.code</code>) defaults to
<code>'ERR_QUIC_STREAM_ABORTED'</code>. Callers who need a more specific code
string can override it via <code>options.code</code> — the numeric QUIC code
is unaffected.</p>
<p>The Node.js error code is fixed at <code>'ERR_QUIC_STREAM_ABORTED'</code> so that
catch blocks can distinguish a <code>QuicError</code> from other Node.js errors
without checking the prototype chain. The numeric QUIC code lives on
the separate <a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a> property to avoid colliding with
the Node.js convention that <code>error.code</code> is a string.</p>
<h3><code>new QuicError(message, options)</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>message</code> {string} A human-readable description of the error.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>errorCode</code> {bigint | number} The numeric QUIC error code. Numbers
are coerced to <code>BigInt</code>. Must be a non-negative 62-bit unsigned
varint (<code>0n &lt;= errorCode &lt;= 2n ** 62n - 1n</code>).</li>
<li><code>code</code> {string} The Node.js-style error code string assigned to
<code>error.code</code>. Defaults to <code>'ERR_QUIC_STREAM_ABORTED'</code>.</li>
<li><code>type</code> {string} Either <code>'application'</code> (default) or <code>'transport'</code>.
Indicates whether the code is defined by the negotiated
application protocol (e.g. RFC 9114 for HTTP/3) or by the QUIC
transport layer (RFC 9000). Stream resets always carry application
codes, so the default is <code>'application'</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { QuicError } from 'node:quic';

const err = new QuicError('rejecting stream', { errorCode: 0x10cn });
console.log(err.code);       // 'ERR_QUIC_STREAM_ABORTED'
console.log(err.errorCode);  // 268n
console.log(err.type);       // 'application'

const custom = new QuicError('custom failure', {
  errorCode: 0x10cn,
  code: 'ERR_MY_QUIC_FAILURE',
});
console.log(custom.code);    // 'ERR_MY_QUIC_FAILURE'
</code></pre>
<h3><code>error.errorCode</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint}</li>
</ul>
<p>The numeric QUIC error code carried by this error.</p>
<h3><code>error.type</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>Either <code>'application'</code> or <code>'transport'</code>. Indicates the namespace of
<a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a>.</p>
<h2>Class: <code>QuicStream</code></h2>
<h3><code>stream.opened</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Promise}</li>
</ul>
<p>A promise that is immediately fulfilled, if the stream fits within
flow control limits or fulfilled when the pending stream is created.
It rejects, if a pending stream is closed with an error before being
created.</p>
<h3><code>stream.closed</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Promise}</li>
</ul>
<p>A promise that is fulfilled when the stream is fully closed. It resolves
when the stream closes cleanly (including idle timeout). It rejects with
an <code>ERR_QUIC_APPLICATION_ERROR</code> or <code>ERR_QUIC_TRANSPORT_ERROR</code> when the
stream is closed due to a QUIC error (e.g., stream reset by the peer,
CONNECTION_CLOSE with a non-zero error code).</p>
<h3><code>stream.destroy([error[, options]])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>error</code> {any}</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>code</code> {bigint|number} The application error code to include in the
<code>RESET_STREAM</code> and <code>STOP_SENDING</code> frames sent to the peer. Numbers are
coerced to <code>BigInt</code>. When omitted, the wire code is derived from <code>error</code>
(see below).</li>
<li><code>reason</code> {string} An optional human-readable reason string. Accepted for
symmetry with <a href="#sessioncloseoptions"><code>session.close()</code></a> and <a href="#sessiondestroyerror-options"><code>session.destroy()</code></a>, but
<strong>not transmitted on the wire</strong> — neither <code>RESET_STREAM</code> nor
<code>STOP_SENDING</code> carry a reason field. Provided for application logging
and for use by the <a href="#streamonerror"><code>stream.onerror</code></a> callback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately and abruptly destroys the stream. If <code>error</code> is provided and
<a href="#streamonerror"><code>stream.onerror</code></a> is set, the <code>onerror</code> callback is invoked before
destruction. The <code>stream.closed</code> promise rejects with the error.</p>
<p>When the stream is destroyed with an <code>error</code> (or with an explicit
<code>options.code</code>), the QUIC stack signals the abort to the peer:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the writable side is still open, a <code>RESET_STREAM</code> frame is sent.</li>
<li>If the readable side is still open (a bidirectional stream, or a
remote-initiated unidirectional stream), a <code>STOP_SENDING</code> frame is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both frames carry the same wire code, resolved with the following
precedence:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>options.code</code>, when explicitly provided.</li>
<li><a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a>, when <code>error</code> is a <a href="#class-quicerror"><code>QuicError</code></a>.</li>
<li>The negotiated application protocol's &quot;internal error&quot; code
(<code>H3_INTERNAL_ERROR</code> (<code>0x102</code>) for HTTP/3, or the QUIC transport-layer
<code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> (<code>0x1</code>) for raw QUIC).</li>
</ol>
<p>A clean destroy — no <code>error</code> and no <code>options.code</code> — does not emit
<code>RESET_STREAM</code> or <code>STOP_SENDING</code>; the stream's existing close machinery
handles teardown.</p>
<p>See <a href="#aborting-a-stream">Aborting a stream</a> for an overview of the available stream-abort
APIs.</p>
<h3><code>stream.destroyed</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>True if <code>stream.destroy()</code> has been called.</p>
<h3>Aborting a stream</h3>
<p>A QuicStream can be aborted in several ways, each producing different
wire-frame side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#streamstopsendingcode"><code>stream.stopSending()</code></a> — Aborts only the readable side. Sends
<code>STOP_SENDING</code> to the peer. The writable side is unaffected.</li>
<li><a href="#streamresetstreamcode"><code>stream.resetStream()</code></a> — Aborts only the writable side. Sends
<code>RESET_STREAM</code> to the peer. Unlike <a href="#streamwriter"><code>writer.fail(reason)</code></a>, the wire
code is given directly rather than derived from an error.</li>
<li><a href="#streamwriter"><code>writer.fail(reason)</code></a> — Aborts only the writable side. Sends
<code>RESET_STREAM</code> to the peer. The readable side is unaffected; any data
already buffered for read remains available.</li>
<li><a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a> with an <code>error</code> argument — Tears the stream
down completely. Sends <code>RESET_STREAM</code> on any still-open writable side
<strong>and</strong> <code>STOP_SENDING</code> on any still-open readable side. The wire code
is derived from <code>error</code> (see <a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a> for the precedence
rules).</li>
<li><a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a> with an explicit <code>options.code</code> — Same as the
previous form but with a caller-supplied wire code, which takes
precedence over any code carried by <code>error</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>error</code> is a <a href="#class-quicerror"><code>QuicError</code></a>, its <a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a> is used as
the wire code for both <code>writer.fail()</code> and <code>stream.destroy()</code>. Otherwise
the implementation falls back to the negotiated application protocol's
&quot;internal error&quot; code (see <a href="#class-quicerror"><code>QuicError</code></a>).</p>
<p><a href="#streamstopsendingcode"><code>stream.stopSending()</code></a> and <a href="#streamresetstreamcode"><code>stream.resetStream()</code></a> do
not perform this derivation: they send <code>code</code> as given.</p>
<h3><code>stream.resetStream([code])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>code</code> {number|bigint} The application error code to send to the peer.
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>0n</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tells the peer that this end will not send any more data on this stream,
sending a <code>RESET_STREAM</code> frame carrying <code>code</code>. The readable side is left
open, so data already sent by the peer remains available to read.</p>
<p>Any data still queued for sending is discarded. A reset stream is never
acknowledged by the peer, so the outbound queue can no longer drain.</p>
<p>No acknowledgement of this action is provided. The call does nothing if the
stream has been destroyed, if it has already been reset, or if it is a
remote-initiated unidirectional stream, which has no writable side to abort.</p>
<h3><code>stream.stopSending([code])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>code</code> {number|bigint} The application error code to send to the peer.
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>0n</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Asks the peer to stop sending data on this stream, sending a <code>STOP_SENDING</code>
frame carrying <code>code</code>. The writable side is left open, so this end can
still send data.</p>
<p>No acknowledgement of this action is provided. The call does nothing if the
stream has been destroyed, or if it is a locally-initiated unidirectional
stream, which has no readable side to abort.</p>
<h3><code>stream.early</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>True if any data on this stream was received as 0-RTT (early data)
before the TLS handshake completed. Early data is less secure and
could potentially be replayed by an attacker. Applications should
treat early data with appropriate caution.</p>
<p>This property is only meaningful on the server side. On the client
side, it is always <code>false</code>.</p>
<h3><code>stream.direction</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string|null} One of <code>'bidi'</code>, <code>'uni'</code>, or <code>null</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The directionality of the stream, or <code>null</code> if the stream has been destroyed
or is still pending. Read only.</p>
<h3><code>stream.budget</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of bytes that the writer will buffer before
<code>writeSync()</code> returns <code>false</code>. When the buffered data exceeds this limit,
the caller should wait for drain before writing more.</p>
<p>The value can be changed dynamically at any time. This is particularly
useful for streams received via the <code>onstream</code> callback, where the
default (65536) may need to be adjusted based on application needs.
The valid range is <code>0</code> to <code>4294967295</code>.</p>
<h3><code>stream.id</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|null}</li>
</ul>
<p>The stream ID, or <code>null</code> if the stream has been destroyed or is still
pending. Read only.</p>
<h3><code>stream.onerror</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>An optional callback invoked when the stream is destroyed with an error.
This includes errors caused by user callbacks that throw or reject (see
<a href="#callback-error-handling">Callback error handling</a>). The callback receives a single argument: the
error that triggered the destruction. If the <code>onerror</code> callback itself throws
or returns a promise that rejects, the error is surfaced as an uncaught
exception. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.onblocked</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnBlockedCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the stream is blocked. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.onreset</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnStreamErrorCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the peer aborts a direction of the stream by
sending a <code>RESET_STREAM</code> frame (the peer abandons their writable side, so
no further data will arrive on our readable side).</p>
<p>The callback receives a Node.js error whose <code>errorCode</code> (<code>bigint</code>)
property carries the application error code from the wire frame.</p>
<p>The stream is <strong>not</strong> automatically destroyed when this callback fires —
the application chooses how to react. Common patterns are: ignore (and
continue using the still-active direction on a bidirectional stream),
abort the other direction with <a href="#streamwriter"><code>writer.fail()</code></a>, or tear down the
whole stream with <a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a>. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.onstopsending</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.OnStreamErrorCallback}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the peer aborts a direction of the stream by
sending a <code>STOP_SENDING</code> frame (the peer asks us to stop writing on our
writable side).</p>
<p>The callback receives a Node.js error whose <code>errorCode</code> (<code>bigint</code>)
property carries the application error code from the wire frame. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.headers</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>The buffered initial headers received on this stream, or <code>undefined</code> if the
application does not support headers or no headers have been received yet.
For server-side streams, this contains the request headers (e.g., <code>:method</code>,
<code>:path</code>, <code>:scheme</code>). For client-side streams, this contains the response
headers (e.g., <code>:status</code>).</p>
<p>Header names are lowercase strings. Multi-value headers are represented as
arrays. The object has <code>__proto__: null</code>.</p>
<h3><code>stream.onheaders</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when initial headers are received on the stream. The
callback receives <code>(headers)</code> where <code>headers</code> is an object (same format as
<code>stream.headers</code>). For HTTP/3, this delivers request pseudo-headers on the
server side and response headers on the client side. Throws
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if set on a session that does not support headers.
Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.ontrailers</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when trailing headers are received from the peer.
The callback receives <code>(trailers)</code> where <code>trailers</code> is an object in the
same format as <code>stream.headers</code>. Throws <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if set on a
session that does not support headers. Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.oninfo</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when informational (1xx) headers are received from
the server. The callback receives <code>(headers)</code> where <code>headers</code> is an object
in the same format as <code>stream.headers</code>. Informational headers are sent
before the final response (e.g., 103 Early Hints). Throws
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if set on a session that does not support headers.
Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.onwanttrailers</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Function}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback to invoke when the application is ready for trailing headers
to be sent. This is called synchronously — the user must call
<a href="#streamsendtrailersheaders"><code>stream.sendTrailers()</code></a> within this callback. Throws
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if set on a session that does not support headers.
Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.pendingTrailers</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object|undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>Set trailing headers to be sent automatically when the application requests
them. This is an alternative to the <a href="#streamonwanttrailers"><code>stream.onwanttrailers</code></a> callback
for cases where the trailers are known before the body completes. Throws
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if set on a session that does not support headers.
Read/write.</p>
<h3><code>stream.sendHeaders(headers[, options])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>headers</code> {Object} Header object with string keys and string or
string-array values. Pseudo-headers (<code>:method</code>, <code>:path</code>, etc.) must
appear before regular headers.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>terminal</code> {boolean} If <code>true</code>, the stream is closed for sending
after the headers (no body will follow). <strong>Default:</strong> <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>Sends initial or response headers on the stream. For client-side streams,
this sends request headers. For server-side streams, this sends response
headers. Throws <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if the session does not support headers.</p>
<h3><code>stream.sendInformationalHeaders(headers)</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>headers</code> {Object} Header object. Must include <code>:status</code> with a 1xx
value (e.g., <code>{ ':status': '103', 'link': '&lt;/style.css&gt;; rel=preload' }</code>).</li>
<li>Returns: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>Sends informational (1xx) response headers. Server only. Throws
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if the session does not support headers.</p>
<h3><code>stream.sendTrailers(headers)</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>headers</code> {Object} Trailing header object. Pseudo-headers must not be
included in trailers.</li>
<li>Returns: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>Sends trailing headers on the stream. Must be called synchronously during
the <a href="#streamonwanttrailers"><code>stream.onwanttrailers</code></a> callback, or set ahead of time via
<a href="#streampendingtrailers"><code>stream.pendingTrailers</code></a>. Throws <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if the session
does not support headers.</p>
<h3><code>stream.priority</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object|null}
<ul>
<li><code>level</code> {string} One of <code>'high'</code>, <code>'default'</code>, or <code>'low'</code>.</li>
<li><code>incremental</code> {boolean} Whether the stream data should be interleaved
with other streams of the same priority level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The current priority of the stream. Returns <code>null</code> if the session does not
support priority (e.g. non-HTTP/3) or if the stream has been destroyed.
Read only. Use <a href="#streamsetpriorityoptions"><code>stream.setPriority()</code></a> to change the priority.</p>
<p>On client-side HTTP/3 sessions, the value reflects what was set via
<a href="#streamsetpriorityoptions"><code>stream.setPriority()</code></a>. On server-side HTTP/3 sessions, the value
reflects the peer's requested priority (e.g., from <code>PRIORITY_UPDATE</code> frames).</p>
<h3><code>stream.setPriority([options])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>level</code> {string} The priority level. One of <code>'high'</code>, <code>'default'</code>, or
<code>'low'</code>. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>'default'</code>.</li>
<li><code>incremental</code> {boolean} When <code>true</code>, data from this stream may be
interleaved with data from other streams of the same priority level.
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sets the priority of the stream. Throws <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if the session
does not support priority (e.g. non-HTTP/3). Has no effect if the stream
has been destroyed.</p>
<h3><code>stream[Symbol.asyncIterator]()</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Returns: {AsyncIterableIterator} yielding {Uint8Array[]}</li>
</ul>
<p>The stream implements <code>Symbol.asyncIterator</code>, making it directly usable
in <code>for await...of</code> loops. Each iteration yields a batch of <code>Uint8Array</code>
chunks.</p>
<p>Only one async iterator can be obtained per stream. A second call throws
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code>. Non-readable streams (outbound-only unidirectional
or closed) return an immediately-finished iterator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">for await (const chunks of stream) {
  for (const chunk of chunks) {
    // Process each Uint8Array chunk
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compatible with stream/iter utilities:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import Stream from 'node:stream/iter';
const body = await Stream.bytes(stream);
const text = await Stream.text(stream);
await Stream.pipeTo(stream, someWriter);
</code></pre>
<h3><code>stream.writer</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object}</li>
</ul>
<p>Returns a Writer object for pushing data to the stream incrementally.
The Writer implements the stream/iter Writer interface with the
try-sync-fallback-to-async pattern.</p>
<p>Only available when no <code>body</code> source was provided at creation time or via
<a href="#streamsetbodybody"><code>stream.setBody()</code></a>. Non-writable streams return an already-closed
Writer. Throws <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if the outbound is already configured.</p>
<p>The Writer has the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>writeSync(chunk)</code> — Synchronous write. Returns <code>true</code> if accepted,
<code>false</code> if flow-controlled. Data is NOT accepted on <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>write(chunk[, options])</code> — Async write. Rejects with <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code>
when the stream is flow-controlled rather than waiting for capacity.
<code>options.signal</code> is checked at entry but not observed during the write.</li>
<li><code>writevSync(chunks)</code> — Synchronous vectored write. All-or-nothing.</li>
<li><code>writev(chunks[, options])</code> — Async vectored write. Rejects with
<code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> when the stream is flow-controlled rather than waiting
for capacity.</li>
<li><code>endSync()</code> — Synchronous close. Returns total bytes or <code>-1</code>.</li>
<li><code>end([options])</code> — Async close. If a drain is already pending, waits for it
before closing.</li>
<li><code>fail(reason)</code> — Errors the stream (sends <code>RESET_STREAM</code> to peer).
When <code>reason</code> is a <a href="#class-quicerror"><code>QuicError</code></a>, its <a href="#errorerrorcode"><code>error.errorCode</code></a> is used
as the wire code on the resulting <code>RESET_STREAM</code> frame; otherwise
the wire code falls back to the negotiated application protocol's
&quot;internal error&quot; code (<code>H3_INTERNAL_ERROR</code> (<code>0x102</code>) for HTTP/3, or
the QUIC transport-layer <code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> (<code>0x1</code>) for raw QUIC).
See <a href="#streamdestroyerror-options"><code>stream.destroy()</code></a> for a full-stream abort that also resets
the readable side via <code>STOP_SENDING</code>.</li>
<li><code>canWrite</code> — <code>true</code> if writes will be accepted, <code>false</code> if at capacity,
or <code>null</code> if closed/errored. When <code>writeSync()</code> returns <code>false</code>, use
<code>ondrain()</code> from <code>node:stream/iter</code> to wait before retrying. If <code>ondrain()</code>
returns <code>null</code>, no drain wait is available and the write should not be
retried.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { ondrain } from 'node:stream/iter';

while (!writer.writeSync(chunk)) {
  const drain = ondrain(writer);
  if (drain === null) break;
  await drain;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The bytes from each <code>writeSync()</code> / <code>writevSync()</code> / <code>write()</code> / <code>writev()</code>
input chunk are copied into an internal buffer, so the caller's source
buffer is unchanged and may be reused or mutated immediately after the
call returns. Callers that want to ensure a source buffer cannot be
mutated after handing it off can call <code>ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer()</code>
themselves before passing the buffer.</p>
<h3><code>stream.setBody(body)</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>body</code> {string | ArrayBuffer | SharedArrayBuffer | ArrayBufferView |
Blob | FileHandle | AsyncIterable | Iterable | Promise | null}</li>
</ul>
<p>Sets the outbound body source for the stream. Can only be called once.
Mutually exclusive with <a href="#streamwriter"><code>stream.writer</code></a>.</p>
<p>The following body source types are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>null</code> — The writable side is closed immediately (FIN sent with no data).</li>
<li><code>string</code> — UTF-8 encoded and sent as a single chunk.</li>
<li><code>ArrayBuffer</code>, <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>, <code>ArrayBufferView</code> — Sent as a single
chunk. The bytes are copied into an internal buffer, so the caller's
source buffer is unchanged and may be reused or mutated immediately
after the call returns. Callers wanting to ensure their source cannot
be mutated after handing it off can call
<code>ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer()</code> themselves before passing the buffer.</li>
<li><code>Blob</code> — Sent from the Blob's underlying data queue.</li>
<li>{FileHandle} — The file contents are read asynchronously via an
fd-backed data source. The <code>FileHandle</code> must be opened for reading
(e.g. via <a href="fs.md#fspromisesopenpath-flags-mode"><code>fs.promises.open(path, 'r')</code></a>). Once passed as a body, the
<code>FileHandle</code> is locked and cannot be used as a body for another stream.
The <code>FileHandle</code> is automatically closed when the stream finishes.</li>
<li><code>AsyncIterable</code>, <code>Iterable</code> — Each yielded chunk (string or
<code>Uint8Array</code>) is written incrementally in streaming mode.</li>
<li><code>Promise</code> — Awaited; the resolved value is used as the body (subject
to the same type rules).</li>
</ul>
<p>Throws <code>ERR_INVALID_STATE</code> if the outbound is already configured or if
the writer has been accessed.</p>
<h3><code>stream.session</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.QuicSession|null}</li>
</ul>
<p>The session that created this stream, or <code>null</code> if the stream has been
destroyed. Read only.</p>
<h3><code>stream.stats</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.QuicStream.Stats}</li>
</ul>
<p>The current statistics for the stream. Read only.</p>
<h2>Class: <code>QuicStream.Stats</code></h2>
<h3><code>streamStats.ackedAt</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint}</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>streamStats.bytesAccumulated</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint}</li>
</ul>
<p>The current number of bytes sitting in the stream's receive accumulation
buffer, awaiting delivery to the application. A value near zero indicates
the reader is keeping up with incoming data. A value near the stream's
flow control window indicates the application is not consuming data fast
enough.</p>
<h3><code>streamStats.bytesReceived</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint}</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>streamStats.bytesSent</code></h3>

<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint}</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>streamStats.maxBytesAccumulated</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint}</li>
</ul>
<p>The peak number of bytes that were accumulated in the stream's receive
buffer at any point during the stream's lifetime. This value only
increases monotonically. It is useful for diagnosing whether a stream
experienced backpressure episodes and whether the accumulation buffer
sizing is appropriate for the workload.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<h3>type: <code>ApplicationOptions</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object}</li>
</ul>
<p>The application specific options.</p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.maxHeaderPairs</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum number of header name-value pairs accepted per header block.
Headers beyond this limit are silently dropped. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>128</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.maxHeaderLength</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum total byte length of all header names and values combined per header
block. Headers that would push the total over this limit are silently
dropped. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>8192</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.maxFieldSectionSize</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum size of a compressed header field section (QPACK). <code>0</code> means
unlimited. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>0</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.qpackMaxDTableCapacity</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>QPACK dynamic table capacity in bytes. Set to <code>0</code> to disable the dynamic
table. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>4096</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.qpackEncoderMaxDTableCapacity</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>QPACK encoder maximum dynamic table capacity. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>4096</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.qpackBlockedStreams</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum number of streams that can e blocked waiting for QPACK dynamic table
updates. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>100</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.enableConnectProtocol</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>Enable the extended CONNECT protocol (RFC 9220). <strong>Default:</strong> <code>false</code></p>
<h4><code>applicationOptions.enableDatagrams</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>Enable HTTP/3 datagrams (RFC 9297). <strong>Default:</strong> <code>false</code></p>
<h3>Type: <code>EndpointOptions</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object}</li>
</ul>
<p>The endpoint configuration options passed when constructing a new <code>QuicEndpoint</code> instance.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.address</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {net.SocketAddress | string} The local UDP address and port the endpoint should bind to.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not specified the endpoint will bind to IPv4 <code>localhost</code> on a random port.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.blockList</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {net.BlockList}</li>
</ul>
<p>An optional <a href="net.md#class-netblocklist"><code>net.BlockList</code></a> instance for filtering incoming packets by
source address. When configured, every received UDP packet is checked against
the block list before any QUIC processing occurs, minimizing resource
expenditure on blocked sources. The block list is evaluated live — rules
added to the <code>BlockList</code> object after the endpoint is created take effect
immediately.</p>
<p>See <a href="#endpointoptionsblocklistpolicy"><code>endpointOptions.blockListPolicy</code></a> for how matches are interpreted.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.blockListPolicy</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string} One of <code>'deny'</code> or <code>'allow'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>'deny'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Controls how the <a href="#endpointoptionsblocklist"><code>endpointOptions.blockList</code></a> is interpreted:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'deny'</code> — Packets from addresses matching the block list are dropped.
All other addresses are accepted. This is the typical blocklist mode.</li>
<li><code>'allow'</code> — Only packets from addresses matching the block list are
accepted. All other addresses are dropped. This is an allowlist mode
for restricting access to known clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no block list is configured, this option has no effect.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.addressLRUSize</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>The endpoint maintains an internal cache of validated socket addresses as a
performance optimization. This option sets the maximum number of addresses
that are cached. The value must be greater than <code>0</code>. This is an advanced option
that users typically won't have need to specify.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.disableStatelessReset</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, the endpoint will not send stateless reset packets in response
to packets from unknown connections. Stateless resets allow a peer to detect
that a connection has been lost even when the server has no state for it.
Disabling them may be useful in testing or when stateless resets are handled
at a different layer.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.idleTimeout</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li>Default: <code>0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The number of seconds an endpoint will remain alive after all sessions have
closed and it is no longer listening. A value of <code>0</code> (default) means the
endpoint is only destroyed when explicitly closed via <code>endpoint.close()</code> or
<code>endpoint.destroy()</code>. A positive value starts an idle timer when the endpoint
becomes idle; if no new sessions are created before the timer fires, the
endpoint is automatically destroyed. This is useful for connection pooling
where endpoints should linger briefly for reuse by future <code>connect()</code> calls.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.ipv6Only</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, indicates that the endpoint should bind only to IPv6 addresses.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.reusePort</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
<li>Default: <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, allows multiple endpoints (across separate processes) to bind to
the same address and port. The kernel will load-balance incoming UDP datagrams
across all sockets bound with this option. This enables horizontal scaling of
QUIC servers by running multiple Node.js processes on the same port.</p>
<p>Supported on Linux 3.9+ and DragonFlyBSD 3.6+. On unsupported platforms, the
bind will fail with an error.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.maxConnectionsPerHost</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li>Default: <code>0</code> (unlimited)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of concurrent sessions allowed per remote IP
address (ignoring port). When the limit is reached, new connections from the
same IP are refused with <code>CONNECTION_REFUSED</code>. A value of <code>0</code> disables the
limit. The maximum value is <code>65535</code>.</p>
<p>This limit can also be changed dynamically after construction via
<a href="#endpointmaxconnectionsperhost"><code>endpoint.maxConnectionsPerHost</code></a>.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.maxConnectionsTotal</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li>Default: <code>0</code> (unlimited)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum total number of concurrent sessions across all remote
addresses. When the limit is reached, new connections are refused with
<code>CONNECTION_REFUSED</code>. A value of <code>0</code> disables the limit. The maximum value is
<code>65535</code>.</p>
<p>This limit can also be changed dynamically after construction via
<a href="#endpointmaxconnectionstotal"><code>endpoint.maxConnectionsTotal</code></a>.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.retryRate</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of QUIC retry packets the endpoint will send per second.
This is a global rate limit (not per-host) that caps the total server-wide
retry response rate, preventing spoofed-source floods from consuming unbounded
resources.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.retryBurst</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>200</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum burst of retry packets allowed before rate limiting takes effect.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.statelessResetRate</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of stateless reset packets the endpoint will send per second.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.statelessResetBurst</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>200</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum burst of stateless reset packets allowed before rate limiting
takes effect.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.versionNegotiationRate</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of version negotiation packets the endpoint will send per
second.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.versionNegotiationBurst</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>200</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum burst of version negotiation packets allowed before rate limiting
takes effect.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.immediateCloseRate</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of immediate connection close packets the endpoint will
send per second.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.immediateCloseBurst</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>200</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum burst of immediate connection close packets allowed before rate
limiting takes effect.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.sessionCreationRate</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>50</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of new sessions that a single remote address can create per
second. This is a per-host rate limit tracked in the address validation LRU
cache. It prevents a validated remote address from churning through sessions
(rapidly opening and abandoning connections) faster than the server can handle.
For benchmarking where traffic comes from a single source, set this to a high
value.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.sessionCreationBurst</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum burst of new session creations allowed from a single remote address
before rate limiting takes effect.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.retryTokenExpiration</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the length of time a QUIC retry token is considered valid.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.resetTokenSecret</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBufferView}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the 16-byte secret used to generate QUIC retry tokens.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.tokenExpiration</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the length of time a QUIC token is considered valid.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.tokenSecret</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBufferView}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the 16-byte secret used to generate QUIC tokens.</p>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.udpReceiveBufferSize</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.udpSendBufferSize</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.udpTTL</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>endpointOptions.validateAddress</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, requires that the endpoint validate peer addresses using retry packets
while establishing a new connection.</p>
<h3>Type: <code>SessionOptions</code></h3>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.alpn</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string} (client) | {string[]} (server)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) identifier(s).</p>
<p>For <strong>client</strong> sessions, this is a single string specifying the protocol
the client wants to use (e.g. <code>'h3'</code>).</p>
<p>For <strong>server</strong> sessions, this is a non-empty array of protocol names in
preference order that the server supports (e.g. <code>['h3', 'h3-29']</code>).
During the TLS handshake, the server selects the first protocol from its
list that the client also supports.</p>
<p>The negotiated ALPN determines which Application implementation is used
for the session. <code>'h3'</code> and <code>'h3-*'</code> variants select the HTTP/3
application; all other values select the default application.</p>
<p>Default: <code>'h3'</code></p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.application</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.ApplicationOptions}</li>
</ul>
<p>Application-specific options.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">const { listen } = await import('node:quic');

await listen((session) =&gt; { /* ... */ }, {
  application: {
    maxHeaderPairs: 64,
    qpackMaxDTableCapacity: 8192,
    enableDatagrams: true,
  },
  // ... other session options
});
</code></pre>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.ca</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBuffer|ArrayBufferView|ArrayBuffer[]|ArrayBufferView[]}</li>
</ul>
<p>The CA certificates to use for sessions.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.cc</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the congestion control algorithm that will be used.
Must be set to one of either <code>'reno'</code>, <code>'cubic'</code>, or <code>'bbr'</code>.</p>
<p>This is an advanced option that users typically won't have need to specify.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.certs</code> (client only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBuffer|ArrayBufferView|ArrayBuffer[]|ArrayBufferView[]}</li>
</ul>
<p>The TLS certificates to use for client sessions. For server sessions,
certificates are specified per-identity in the <a href="#sessionoptionssni-server-only"><code>sessionOptions.sni</code></a> map.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.certificateCompression</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string[]} One or more of <code>'zlib'</code>, <code>'brotli'</code>, or <code>'zstd'</code>, in
preference order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enables TLS certificate compression (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8879">RFC 8879</a>) for this session. When
omitted, certificate compression is disabled.</p>
<p>On the server side, the certificate chain is compressed using the first
listed algorithm that the client advertises support for. On the client side,
the listed algorithms are advertised to the server so that the server may
compress its certificate. When client authentication is in use, the option
also controls compression of the client's certificate.</p>
<p>Compressing the certificate chain is especially useful for QUIC because it
reduces the size of the server's first flight, which is bounded by the
anti-amplification limit (see <a href="#certificate-size-and-handshake-performance">Certificate size and handshake
performance</a>). Certificate compression requires TLS 1.3, which QUIC always
uses.</p>
<p>At most three algorithms may be specified. The option is silently ignored if
Node.js was built against a shared OpenSSL that lacks certificate compression
support.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.ciphers</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of supported TLS 1.3 cipher algorithms.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.crl</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBuffer|ArrayBufferView|ArrayBuffer[]|ArrayBufferView[]}</li>
</ul>
<p>The CRL to use for sessions.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.enableEarlyData</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean} <strong>Default:</strong> <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, enables TLS 0-RTT early data for this session. Early data
allows the client to send application data before the TLS handshake
completes, reducing latency on reconnection when a valid session ticket
is available. Set to <code>false</code> to disable early data support.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.groups</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of supported TLS 1.3 cipher groups.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.keylog</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, enables TLS key logging for the session. Key material is
delivered to the <a href="#sessiononkeylog"><code>session.onkeylog</code></a> callback in <a href="https://udn.realityripple.com/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format">NSS Key Log Format</a>.
Each callback invocation receives a single line of key material. The output
can be used with tools such as Wireshark to decrypt captured QUIC traffic.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.keys</code> (client only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {KeyObject|KeyObject[]}</li>
</ul>
<p>The TLS crypto keys to use for client sessions. For server sessions,
keys are specified per-identity in the <a href="#sessionoptionssni-server-only"><code>sessionOptions.sni</code></a> map.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.maxPayloadSize</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum UDP packet payload size.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.maxStreamWindow</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum stream flow-control window size.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.maxWindow</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum session flow-control window size.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.minVersion</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum QUIC version number to allow. This is an advanced option that users
typically won't have need to specify.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.preferredAddressPolicy</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string} One of <code>'use'</code>, <code>'ignore'</code>, or <code>'default'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>'ignore'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When the remote peer advertises a preferred address, this option specifies whether
to use it or ignore it. The default is <code>'ignore'</code> because honoring a server's
preferred address causes the client to migrate its connection to a different IP
address, which can be exploited for data exfiltration attacks that are
indistinguishable from legitimate QUIC connection migration at the network level.
Set to <code>'use'</code> only when connecting to trusted servers that require preferred
address migration.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.qlog</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code>, enables <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema/">qlog</a> diagnostic output for the session. Qlog data
is delivered to the <a href="#sessiononqlog"><code>session.onqlog</code></a> callback as chunks of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7464">JSON-SEQ</a>
formatted text. The output can be analyzed with qlog visualization tools
such as <a href="https://qvis.quictools.info/">qvis</a>.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.sessionTicket</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBufferView} A session ticket to use for 0RTT session resumption.</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.datagramDropPolicy</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>'drop-oldest'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Controls which datagram to drop when the pending datagram queue
(sized by <a href="#sessionmaxpendingdatagrams"><code>session.maxPendingDatagrams</code></a>) is full. Must be one of
<code>'drop-oldest'</code> (discard the oldest queued datagram to make room) or
<code>'drop-newest'</code> (reject the incoming datagram). Dropped datagrams are
reported as lost via the <code>ondatagramstatus</code> callback.</p>
<p>This option is immutable after session creation.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.streamIdleTimeout</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>30000</code> (30 seconds)</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum time in milliseconds that a peer-initiated stream can be idle
(no data received) before it is automatically destroyed. This protects
against slowloris-style attacks where a remote peer opens streams but never
sends data, holding server resources indefinitely. Only peer-initiated
streams are checked — locally-initiated streams are the application's
responsibility. Set to <code>0</code> to disable.</p>
<p>The idle check runs as part of the normal send processing loop, so it adds
no additional timers or event loop overhead. The
<code>session.stats.streamsIdleTimedOut</code> counter tracks how many streams have been
destroyed by this mechanism.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.maxDatagramSendAttempts</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum number of <code>SendPendingData</code> cycles a datagram can survive
without being sent before it is abandoned. When a datagram cannot be
sent due to congestion control or packet size constraints, it remains
in the queue and the attempt counter increments. Once the limit is
reached, the datagram is dropped and reported as <code>'abandoned'</code> via the
<code>ondatagramstatus</code> callback. Valid range: <code>1</code> to <code>255</code>.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.drainingPeriodMultiplier</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A multiplier applied to the Probe Timeout (PTO) to compute the draining
period duration after receiving a <code>CONNECTION_CLOSE</code> frame from the peer.
RFC 9000 Section 10.2 requires the draining period to persist for at least
three times the current PTO. The valid range is <code>3</code> to <code>255</code>. Values below
<code>3</code> are clamped to <code>3</code>.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.handshakeTimeout</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of milliseconds a TLS handshake is permitted to take
to complete before timing out.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.initialRtt</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>0</code> (use ngtcp2 default of 333ms)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the initial round-trip time estimate in milliseconds. This value is
used for probe timeout (PTO) computation, initial pacing, and early loss
detection before the first actual RTT sample is collected from the connection.
The default of 333ms is appropriate for the general internet. For low-latency
environments such as loopback or same-rack deployments, setting a value closer
to the actual RTT (e.g., <code>1</code>) avoids unnecessarily conservative initial
behavior.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.keepAlive</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>0</code> (disabled)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the keep-alive timeout in milliseconds. When set to a non-zero
value, PING frames will be sent automatically to keep the connection alive
before the idle timeout fires. The value should be less than the effective
idle timeout (<code>maxIdleTimeout</code> transport parameter) to be useful.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.truncatedReads</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string} One of <code>'error'</code> or <code>'ignore'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>'error'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Controls how reading a stream reports a truncated read. A stream's read side
can end without receiving a QUIC FIN, meaning the peer never signalled that
the whole stream had been sent and the data received may be incomplete. This
selects how the stream's async iterator reports this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>'error'</code> - The default. Peers are expected to always send a FIN to end
their data explicitly, and so any truncation is an error. The iterator yields
the data that did arrive and then throws, so an incomplete stream can never
be mistaken for a complete one. Incomplete streams will either throw a
<code>ERR_QUIC_STREAM_RESET</code> carrying the peer's error code, a connection error,
or <code>ERR_QUIC_STREAM_ABORTED</code> for other cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>'ignore'</code> - The truncation itself is ignored: only a stream or connection
error is reported, and any clean abort/cancellation or similar simply ends
the stream. A non-zero peer reset, non-zero local stop-sending or connection
error still fails, but a truncation with no error at all (an idle timeout,
a graceful close, or a plain <code>stopSending()</code>) ends the read cleanly with the
data received. This matches <code>stream.closed</code>, which rejects only on an error.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.verifyPeer</code> (client only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string} One of <code>'strict'</code>, <code>'auto'</code>, or <code>'manual'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>'auto'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Controls how the client handles server certificate validation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>'strict'</code> — OpenSSL aborts the TLS handshake immediately if the server's
certificate fails validation. The <code>session.opened</code> promise rejects with a
TLS error. The application cannot inspect the certificate or the error
details. This is the most secure mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>'auto'</code> — The TLS handshake completes regardless of validation result.
If validation fails, the <code>session.opened</code> promise is rejected with an error
containing the validation reason, and the session is destroyed. The
<code>onhandshake</code> callback (if set) fires before rejection, allowing diagnostic
logging. This is the default and matches the behavior of <code>tls.connect()</code>
with <code>rejectUnauthorized: true</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>'manual'</code> — The TLS handshake completes regardless of validation result.
The <code>session.opened</code> promise resolves with the handshake info, which includes
<code>validationErrorReason</code> and <code>validationErrorCode</code> if validation failed. The
application is responsible for checking these values and deciding whether to
continue. Use this mode for custom validation logic, certificate pinning, or
intentionally accepting self-signed certificates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.servername</code> (client only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The peer server name to target (SNI). Defaults to <code>'localhost'</code>.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.sni</code> (server only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {Object}</li>
</ul>
<p>An object mapping host names to TLS identity options for Server Name
Indication (SNI) support. This is required for server sessions and must
contain at least one entry. The special key <code>'*'</code> specifies the optional
default/fallback identity used when no other host name matches. If no
wildcard entry is provided, connections with unrecognized server names
will be rejected with a TLS <code>unrecognized_name</code> alert. Each entry may
contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>keys</code> {KeyObject|KeyObject[]} The TLS private keys. <strong>Required.</strong></li>
<li><code>certs</code> {ArrayBuffer|ArrayBufferView|ArrayBuffer[]|ArrayBufferView[]}
The TLS certificates. <strong>Required.</strong></li>
<li><code>verifyPrivateKey</code> {boolean} Verify the private key. Default: <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>port</code> {number} The port to advertise in ORIGIN frames (RFC 9412) for
this host name. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>443</code>. Only used for HTTP/3 sessions.</li>
<li><code>authoritative</code> {boolean} Whether to include this host name in ORIGIN
frames. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>true</code>. Set to <code>false</code> to exclude a host name
from ORIGIN advertisements. Wildcard (<code>'*'</code>) entries are always
excluded regardless of this setting.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">const endpoint = await listen(callback, {
  sni: {
    '*': { keys: [defaultKey], certs: [defaultCert] },
    'api.example.com': { keys: [apiKey], certs: [apiCert], port: 8443 },
    'www.example.com': { keys: [wwwKey], certs: [wwwCert] },
    'internal.example.com': { keys: [intKey], certs: [intCert], authoritative: false },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Shared TLS options (such as <code>ciphers</code>, <code>groups</code>, <code>keylog</code>, and <code>verifyClient</code>)
are specified at the top level of the session options and apply to all
identities. Each SNI entry overrides only the per-identity certificate
fields.</p>
<p>The SNI map can be replaced at runtime using <code>endpoint.setSNIContexts()</code>,
which atomically swaps the map for new sessions while existing sessions
continue to use their original identity.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.tlsTrace</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>True to enable TLS tracing output.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.token</code> (client only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {ArrayBufferView}</li>
</ul>
<p>An opaque address validation token previously received from the server
via the <a href="#sessiononnewtoken"><code>session.onnewtoken</code></a> callback. Providing a valid token on
reconnection allows the client to skip the server's address validation,
reducing handshake latency.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.transportParams</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {quic.TransportParams}</li>
</ul>
<p>The QUIC transport parameters to use for the session.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.unacknowledgedPacketThreshold</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of unacknowledged packets a session should allow.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.rejectUnauthorized</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean} <strong>Default:</strong> <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>true</code>, the peer certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs.
An error is emitted if verification fails; the error can be inspected via
the <code>validationErrorReason</code> and <code>validationErrorCode</code> fields in the
handshake callback. If <code>false</code>, peer certificate verification errors are
ignored.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.reuseEndpoint</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
<li>Default: <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When <code>true</code> (the default), <code>connect()</code> will attempt to reuse an existing
endpoint rather than creating a new one for each session. This provides
connection pooling behavior — multiple sessions can share a single UDP
socket. The reuse logic will not return an endpoint that is listening on
the same address as the connect target (to prevent CID routing conflicts).</p>
<p>Set to <code>false</code> to force creation of a new endpoint for the session. This
is useful when endpoint isolation is required (e.g., testing stateless
reset behavior where source port identity matters).</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.verifyClient</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>True to require verification of TLS client certificate.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.verifyPrivateKey</code> (client only)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {boolean}</li>
</ul>
<p>True to require private key verification for client sessions. For server
sessions, this option is specified per-identity in the
<a href="#sessionoptionssni-server-only"><code>sessionOptions.sni</code></a> map.</p>
<h4><code>sessionOptions.version</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {number}</li>
</ul>
<p>The QUIC version number to use. This is an advanced option that users typically
won't have need to specify.</p>
<h3>Type: <code>TransportParams</code></h3>
<p>The <code>TransportParams</code> type represents the QUIC transport parameters that are
negotiated during session establishment. These parameters are used when
creating a session. The negotiated values can be observed via the
<code>session.localTransportParams</code> and <code>session.remoteTransportParams</code> properties.</p>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialSCID</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial source connection ID (SCID) specified. This field is ignored on
creation of the session and is provided for informational purposes only when
available in the <code>session.localTransportParams</code> and
<code>session.remoteTransportParams</code> properties.</p>
<h4><code>transportParams.originalDCID</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The original destination connection ID (DCID) specified. This field is
ignored on creation of the session and is provided for informational
purposes only when available in the <code>session.localTransportParams</code> and
<code>session.remoteTransportParams</code> properties.</p>
<h4><code>transportParams.preferredAddressIpv4</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {net.SocketAddress} The preferred IPv4 address to advertise (only
used by servers).</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.preferredAddressIpv6</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {net.SocketAddress} The preferred IPv6 address to advertise (only
used by servers)</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialMaxStreamDataBidiLocal</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialMaxStreamDataBidiRemote</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialMaxStreamDataUni</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialMaxData</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialMaxStreamsBidi</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.initialMaxStreamsUni</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.maxIdleTimeout</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.activeConnectionIDLimit</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.ackDelayExponent</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.maxAckDelay</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
</ul>
<h4><code>transportParams.maxDatagramFrameSize</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {bigint|number}</li>
<li><strong>Default:</strong> <code>1200</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum size in bytes of a DATAGRAM frame payload that this endpoint
is willing to receive. Set to <code>0</code> to disable datagram support. The peer
will not send datagrams larger than this value. The actual maximum size of
a datagram that can be <em>sent</em> is determined by the peer's
<code>maxDatagramFrameSize</code>, not this endpoint's value.</p>
<h4><code>transportParams.retrySCID</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>Type: {string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The retry connection ID specified. This field is ignored on creation
of the session and is provided for informational purposes only when
available in the <code>session.localTransportParams</code> and
<code>session.remoteTransportParams</code> properties.</p>
<h2>Callbacks</h2>
<h3>Callback error handling</h3>
<p>All session and stream callbacks may be synchronous functions or async
functions. If a callback throws synchronously or returns a promise that
rejects, the error is caught and the owning session or stream is destroyed
with that error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream callbacks (<code>onblocked</code>, <code>onreset</code>, <code>onstopsending</code>, <code>onheaders</code>,
<code>ontrailers</code>, <code>oninfo</code>, <code>onwanttrailers</code>): the stream is destroyed.</li>
<li>Session callbacks (<code>onapplication</code>, <code>onstream</code>, <code>ondatagram</code>,
<code>ondatagramstatus</code>, <code>onpathvalidation</code>, <code>onsessionticket</code>,
<code>onnewtoken</code>, <code>onversionnegotiation</code>, <code>onorigin</code>, <code>ongoaway</code>,
<code>onhandshake</code>, <code>onkeylog</code>, <code>onqlog</code>): the session is destroyed along
with all of its streams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before destruction, the optional <a href="#sessiononerror"><code>session.onerror</code></a> or
<a href="#streamonerror"><code>stream.onerror</code></a> callback is invoked (if set), giving the application a
chance to observe or log the error. The <code>session.closed</code> or <code>stream.closed</code>
promise will reject with the error.</p>
<p>If the <code>onerror</code> callback itself throws or returns a promise that rejects,
the error from <code>onerror</code> is surfaced as an uncaught exception.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnSessionCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicEndpoint}</li>
<li><code>session</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback function that is invoked when a new server session is initiated by
a remote peer. It is called once the peer's TLS <code>ClientHello</code> has been
processed, so the negotiated TLS parameters are immediately available when
the callback runs. Sessions whose handshake is rejected before this point are
never surfaced.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnStreamCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>

<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
<li><code>id</code> {bigint}</li>
<li><code>status</code> {string} One of <code>'acknowledged'</code>, <code>'lost'</code>, or <code>'abandoned'</code>.
<code>'acknowledged'</code> means the peer confirmed receipt. <code>'lost'</code> means the
datagram was sent but the network lost it. <code>'abandoned'</code> means the
datagram was never sent on the wire (dropped due to queue overflow,
send attempt limit exceeded, or frame size rejection).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnApplicationCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
<li><code>applicationoption</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
</ul>
<p>The callback function that is invoked when application options change.

<li><code>result</code> {string} One of either <code>'success'</code>, <code>'failure'</code>, or <code>'aborted'</code>.</li>
<li><code>newLocalAddress</code> {net.SocketAddress} The local address of the validated path.</li>
<li><code>newRemoteAddress</code> {net.SocketAddress} The remote address of the validated path.</li>
<li><code>oldLocalAddress</code> {net.SocketAddress | null} The local address of the previous
path, or <code>null</code> if this is the first path validation (e.g., preferred address
migration from the client's perspective).</li>
<li><code>oldRemoteAddress</code> {net.SocketAddress | null} The remote address of the previous
path, or <code>null</code>.</li>
<li><code>preferredAddress</code> {boolean} <code>true</code> if the path validation was triggered by
a preferred address migration on the client side. <code>undefined</code> on the server side.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnSessionTicketCallback</code></h3>

<li><code>ticket</code> {Object}</li>
</ul>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnVersionNegotiationCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
<li><code>version</code> {number} The QUIC version that was configured for this session
(the version that the server did not support).</li>
<li><code>requestedVersions</code> {number[]} The versions advertised by the server in
the Version Negotiation packet. These are the versions the server supports.</li>
<li><code>supportedVersions</code> {number[]} The versions supported locally, expressed
as a two-element array <code>[minVersion, maxVersion]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Called when the server responds to the client's Initial packet with a
Version Negotiation packet, indicating that the version used by the client
is not supported. The session is always destroyed immediately after this
callback returns.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnHandshakeCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
<li><code>info</code> {Object} The same object that <code>session.opened</code> resolves with.

a trailing newline character.</li>
</ul>
<p>Called when TLS key material is available. Only fires when
<a href="#sessionoptionskeylog"><code>sessionOptions.keylog</code></a> is <code>true</code>. Multiple lines are emitted during the
TLS 1.3 handshake, each containing a secret label, the client random, and
the secret value.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnQlogCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicSession}</li>
<li><code>data</code> {string} A chunk of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7464">JSON-SEQ</a> formatted <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema/">qlog</a> data.</li>
<li><code>fin</code> {boolean} <code>true</code> if this is the final qlog chunk for the session.</li>
</ul>
<p>Called when qlog diagnostic data is available. Only fires when
<a href="#sessionoptionsqlog"><code>sessionOptions.qlog</code></a> is <code>true</code>. The <code>data</code> chunks should be
concatenated in order to produce the complete qlog output. When <code>fin</code> is
<code>true</code>, no more chunks will be emitted and the concatenated result is a
complete JSON-SEQ document.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnBlockedCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicStream}</li>
</ul>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnStreamErrorCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicStream}</li>
<li><code>error</code> {any}</li>
</ul>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnHeadersCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicStream}</li>
<li><code>headers</code> {Object} Header object with lowercase string keys and
string or string-array values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Called when initial request or response headers are received. For HTTP/3,
this delivers request pseudo-headers on the server and response headers
on the client.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnTrailersCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicStream}</li>
<li><code>trailers</code> {Object} Trailing header object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Called when trailing headers are received from the peer.</p>
<h3>Callback: <code>OnInfoCallback</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>this</code> {quic.QuicStream}</li>
<li><code>headers</code> {Object} Informational header object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Called when informational (1xx) headers are received from the server
(e.g., 103 Early Hints).</p>
<h2>HTTP/3 support</h2>
<p>When the negotiated ALPN identifier is <code>'h3'</code> (or one of the <code>'h3-*'</code>
draft variants), the QUIC session runs the HTTP/3 application backed
by <code>nghttp3</code>. <code>'h3'</code> is the default ALPN for <code>quic.connect()</code> and
<code>quic.listen()</code>, so HTTP/3 is what you get unless you select a
different ALPN explicitly.</p>
<p>Selecting the HTTP/3 application enables a number of stream- and
session-level capabilities that are not available to non-HTTP/3
applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headers and trailers</strong> — request and response header blocks
(including pseudo-headers such as <code>:method</code>, <code>:path</code>, <code>:scheme</code>,
<code>:authority</code>, and <code>:status</code>), trailing headers, and informational
(<code>1xx</code>) responses. See <a href="#streamsendheadersheaders-options"><code>stream.sendHeaders()</code></a>,
<a href="#streamsendtrailersheaders"><code>stream.sendTrailers()</code></a>, and
<a href="#streamsendinformationalheadersheaders"><code>stream.sendInformationalHeaders()</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Stream priority (RFC 9218)</strong> — per-stream urgency and
incremental flags. See <a href="#streampriority"><code>stream.priority</code></a> and
<a href="#streamsetpriorityoptions"><code>stream.setPriority()</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP/3 datagrams (RFC 9297)</strong> — unreliable application-layer
datagrams. The peer must advertise <code>SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM=1</code>, which
is enabled by setting <a href="#sessionoptionsapplication"><code>application.enableDatagrams</code></a> to <code>true</code>
on both peers. See <a href="#sessionsenddatagramdatagram-encoding"><code>session.sendDatagram()</code></a> and
<a href="#sessionondatagram"><code>session.ondatagram</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>ORIGIN frame (RFC 9412)</strong> — servers automatically advertise the
hostnames in their <a href="#sessionoptionssni-server-only"><code>sessionOptions.sni</code></a> map (entries with
<code>authoritative: true</code>); clients receive the list via
<a href="#sessiononorigin"><code>session.onorigin</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>GOAWAY</strong> — graceful shutdown. The server emits <code>GOAWAY</code> as part
of <a href="#sessioncloseoptions"><code>session.close()</code></a>; the client observes it via
<a href="#sessionongoaway"><code>session.ongoaway</code></a> and stops opening new bidirectional streams.</li>
<li><strong>Extended CONNECT settings (RFC 9220)</strong> — the
<code>SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL</code> setting can be enabled via
<a href="#sessionoptionsapplication"><code>application.enableConnectProtocol</code></a>. The setting is exchanged
but the application is responsible for handling the <code>:protocol</code>
pseudo-header and any payload framing on top.</li>
<li><strong>QPACK tuning</strong> — dynamic-table size and blocked-streams limits
via <a href="#sessionoptionsapplication"><code>application.qpackMaxDTableCapacity</code></a> and friends.</li>
</ul>

const stream = await session.createBidirectionalStream({
  headers: {
    ':method': 'GET',
    ':path': '/',
    ':scheme': 'https',
    ':authority': 'example.com',
  },

    console.log('status:', headers[':status']);

</code></pre>
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>session.createBidirectionalStream({ headers })</code> automatically
marks the HEADERS frame as terminal when no <code>body</code> is provided —
the request is <code>HEADERS</code> followed by <code>END_STREAM</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>onheaders</code> callback receives the response pseudo-headers and
regular headers in a single object with lowercase string keys.
For incoming headers, the <code>:status</code> pseudo-header is converted to
a <code>number</code>, matching HTTP/2 behavior. After the callback returns,
the same object is also accessible via <a href="#streamheaders"><code>stream.headers</code></a>.</li>
<li>Reading <code>for await (const chunks of stream)</code> consumes the response
body. Each iteration yields a <code>Uint8Array[]</code> batch of chunks.</li>
<li>HTTP semantic helpers (URL parsing, method/status validation,
redirects, content negotiation, and so on) are intentionally not
built in. The caller is responsible for any HTTP-level handling
beyond the wire framing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minimal HTTP/3 server</h3>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { listen } from 'node:quic';

const encoder = new TextEncoder();

const endpoint = await listen((session) =&gt; {
  // The session.onstream callback fires for each new client-initiated
  // stream. It is optional here: with `onheaders` configured below,
  // request streams are consumed through that callback.
}, {
  sni: { '*': { keys: [defaultKey], certs: [defaultCert] } },
  // ALPN defaults to 'h3'.
  onheaders(headers) {
    // `this` is the QuicStream. Pseudo-headers are available on the
    // request header block (`:method`, `:path`, `:scheme`,
    // `:authority`).
    if (headers[':path'] === '/health') {
      this.sendHeaders({ ':status': '200', 'content-type': 'text/plain' });
      const w = this.writer;
      w.writeSync(encoder.encode('ok\n'));
      w.endSync();
    } else {
      this.sendHeaders({ ':status': '404' }, { terminal: true });
    }
  },
});

console.log('listening on', endpoint.address);
</code></pre>
<p>Server-side notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting <code>onheaders</code> at the <a href="#quiclistenonsession-options"><code>listen()</code></a> level
applies it to every incoming stream (it is wired up before
<code>onstream</code> fires). Setting it inside <code>onstream</code> is too late for
HTTP/3, where the request HEADERS frame is the first thing that
arrives on the stream.</li>
<li><code>this.sendHeaders(headers, { terminal: true })</code> marks the
response HEADERS frame as terminal (no body follows).</li>
<li>For body responses, send headers first, then write to
<code>this.writer</code> and call <code>endSync()</code> to send the body and close the
stream cleanly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is not implemented</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server push</strong> — <code>PUSH_PROMISE</code> and the related push-stream
machinery are not implemented and are not on the near-term
roadmap. Server push has limited deployment in practice, and most
use cases are better served by Early Hints (<code>103</code>) or by direct
fetches from the client.</li>
<li><strong>WebTransport / extended-CONNECT helpers</strong> — the
<code>SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL</code> setting can be negotiated but
there is no built-in support for the <code>:protocol</code> pseudo-header,
WebTransport datagram demultiplexing, or capsule framing.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-level HTTP semantics</strong> — there is no built-in
request/response router, URL parsing, content-encoding
negotiation, body-type coercion, redirect following, or
cookie handling. These are deliberately left to higher-level
libraries built on top of <code>node:quic</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance measurement</h2>
<p>QUIC sessions, streams, and endpoints emit <a href="perf_hooks.md#class-performanceentry"><code>PerformanceEntry</code></a> objects
with <code>entryType</code> set to <code>'quic'</code>. These entries are only created when a
