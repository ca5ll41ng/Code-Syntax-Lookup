# Benchmark runner

<h1>Benchmark runner</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Stability: 1.0 - Early Development</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>node:bench</code> module supports defining and running JavaScript benchmarks in
the current process, and running one benchmark file in a fresh child process.
The module is only available when Node.js is started with the
<code>--experimental-bench</code> flag and can only be imported with the <code>node:</code> scheme:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { bench, suite } from 'node:bench';
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-cjs">const { bench, suite } = require('node:bench');
</code></pre>
<h2>Example benchmark</h2>
<p>Save the following as <code>benchmark.mjs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { bench, suite } from 'node:bench';

suite('URL', () =&gt; {
  const input = 'https://example.com/a?b=c';

  bench('construct', {
    samples: 30,
    params: { input: 'short' },
  }, (b) =&gt; {
    const operations = 10_000;
    let totalLength = 0;

    b.start();
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; operations; i++) {
      totalLength += new URL(input).href.length;
    }
    b.end(operations);

    if (totalLength !== operations * input.length) {
      throw new Error('Unexpected URL result');
    }
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>Run the benchmark from the command line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">node --experimental-bench --bench benchmark.mjs
</code></pre>
<p>Benchmarks are executed serially in declaration order. Declared benchmarks are
scheduled automatically. Call <code>run()</code> during the same turn as the declarations
to consume the event stream or configure filtering.
If an automatically scheduled run fails and <code>run()</code> was not called, the process
exit code is set to <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>Measurement model</h2>
<p>Each warmup and measured sample invokes the benchmark function once with a
fresh {BenchContext}. The function must either call <code>context.start()</code> and
<code>context.end(operations)</code> exactly once, or call <code>context.record(sample)</code> exactly
once to provide an externally measured sample. Setup before <code>start()</code> and
cleanup after <code>end()</code> are outside the measured region. Promise-returning
functions are awaited.</p>
<p>By default, an event loop turn occurs between sample invocations. An embedded
runner can disable this using <code>yieldBetweenSamples</code>. The runner executes
benchmarks serially, but it does not provide process isolation. Other work in
the process, JIT compilation, garbage collection, CPU frequency changes, and
system load can all affect results. Keep raw samples when comparing results and
investigate noisy or skewed distributions rather than treating a confidence
interval as a pass/fail threshold.</p>
<h3>Measurement integrity</h3>
<p>A statistically consistent result does not prove that a benchmark measured the
intended work. An optimizing runtime can remove work whose result is unused or
specialize it more narrowly than the workload being modeled. Framework and loop
overhead can also dominate operations that are too short. To reduce these risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make values produced by measured work observable outside the measured
interval, for example by validating an aggregate derived from every result.
Passing them only through unused local computations is insufficient.</li>
<li>Perform enough operations in each sample to amortize fixed timer reads and
calls to <code>context.start()</code> and <code>context.end()</code>. If loop bookkeeping is material
relative to one operation, batch multiple operations per iteration and report
the total operation count.</li>
<li>Inspect raw <code>samples</code> for trends that indicate insufficient warmup or
optimization tiering, pauses consistent with garbage collection, and
multimodal distributions.</li>
<li>Validate surprising results with an independent benchmark shape that performs
the same intended work differently.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>node:bench</code> does not force a particular optimization state or infer whether an
engine eliminated work. Such controls and diagnostics are runtime-specific and
heuristic, and do not replace validating the benchmark workload.</p>
<h3>Dynamic sampling and variable batches</h3>
<p>Calling <code>context.done()</code> during a measured sample completes the benchmark after
that sample. This allows a higher-level tool to treat <code>samples</code> as a maximum and
implement a dynamic sampling policy.</p>
<p>The number of operations can differ between samples. Summary statistics treat
each sample's <code>rate</code> as one equally weighted observation. In particular,
<code>summary.mean</code> is the arithmetic mean of the per-sample rates. It is not the
pooled throughput calculated as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">1_000_000_000 * sum(sample.operations) / sum(sample.duration_ns)
</code></pre>
<p>The two values can differ when sample durations vary because pooled throughput
weights each per-sample rate by its duration. A higher-level tool that varies
batch sizes should choose the aggregation that matches its analysis. It can
calculate pooled throughput from the raw <code>samples</code>; operation counts should be
summed as <code>bigint</code> values because their total can exceed
<code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code> even though each count cannot.</p>
<h3>Comparing benchmark results</h3>
<p><code>node:bench</code> does not designate a benchmark as a baseline or produce a pass/fail
comparison between runs. It exposes raw samples, stable benchmark identities,
parameters, and tags so that comparison policy can remain in higher-level
tools. A tool can use <code>benchId</code> to match the same declaration and parameters
across compatible source layouts, and use a tag or its own metadata to identify
a baseline.</p>
<p>Comparison tools should retain the raw sample rates and verify that execution
plans and relevant environment details are comparable. The appropriate analysis
depends on the experimental design and distribution. For example, independent
samples might use Welch's t-test or a rank-based test, while observations that
were deliberately paired require paired analysis. Tools should also consider
effect sizes, uncertainty, and correction when testing multiple benchmarks.
The general-purpose {Histogram} statistics in <code>node:perf_hooks</code> can support such
analysis, but the runner does not select a method or significance threshold.</p>
<h2>Reusable runners</h2>
<p>The module-level declaration functions use a shared runner and schedule it
automatically. Higher-level tools can create isolated, explicitly started
runners instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { createRunner } from 'node:bench';

const runner = createRunner({ yieldBetweenSamples: false });

runner.bench('example', { samples: 100 }, (b) =&gt; {
  const operations = chooseOperationCount();
  b.start();
  runOperations(operations);
  const sample = b.end(operations);

  if (hasEnoughData(sample)) b.done();
});

for await (const record of runner.run()) {
  // Consume structured benchmark records.
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each runner has independent declarations, hooks, filtering, and output. Unlike
the module-level declarations, creating a benchmark on an explicit runner does
not schedule execution. This allows packages to collect declarations and start
them later. Calling the explicit runner's <code>run()</code> function prevents additional
declarations and a second call to <code>run()</code> is an error.</p>
<h2>Command-line runner</h2>
<p>The <code>--bench</code> flag runs one or more explicit benchmark files or glob patterns:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">node --experimental-bench --bench benchmark.mjs
node --experimental-bench --bench --bench-reporter=json 'benchmarks/**/*.js'
</code></pre>
<p>Files are sorted and executed serially. The default
<code>--bench-isolation=process</code> mode runs each file in a separate child process and
emits one aggregate summary. Structured events are transferred to the parent
without JSON conversion, preserving BigInt durations, errors, and parameter
values. Child writes to stdout and stderr are emitted as diagnostic records so
they do not corrupt reporter output.</p>
<p><code>--bench-isolation=none</code> imports all files into the runner process. This mode
has lower startup overhead, but module, heap, and process state carry between
files, and user writes share stdout and stderr with reporters.</p>
<p>Worker-thread isolation is not a CLI mode. Each newly constructed {Worker} has a
separate V8 isolate, JavaScript heap, and event loop, typically with lower
startup cost than a child process. Reusing a worker preserves its module and heap
state. Workers also share libuv's process-wide thread pool and can share
process-global native or addon state, so they do not provide the same boundary
as process isolation.</p>
<p>Higher-level tools can experiment with worker isolation by loading benchmark
code inside a worker, measuring there, transferring structured sample data, and
passing it to <a href="#contextrecordsample"><code>context.record()</code></a>. The reported <code>duration_ns</code> can exclude
message transport when the worker captures both timestamps. Tools should
identify worker modules and workloads explicitly. They should not stringify
arbitrary functions or closures to move them between isolates, because closures
cannot be reconstructed with their original lexical environment.</p>
<p>Benchmark files passed to <code>--bench</code> should declare benchmarks but must not call
<code>run()</code>. The CLI supports <code>--bench-name-pattern</code>, <code>--bench-samples</code>,
<code>--bench-warmup</code>, <code>--bench-reporter</code>, and <code>--bench-reporter-destination</code>. See
the <a href="cli.md#--bench">command-line options documentation</a> for details.</p>
<p>Preload modules passed through <code>--require</code> or <code>--import</code> should not declare
benchmarks. Such declarations are not associated with an entry file and have
an <code>entryFile</code> value of <code>null</code>. Their <code>fileRunId</code> identifies the runner or child
execution in which they occurred. With process isolation, a preload is evaluated
and its declarations run once for every benchmark child process.</p>
<h2>Benchmark reporters</h2>
<p>The built-in reporters are available from the scheme-only
<code>node:bench/reporters</code> module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { json, spec } from 'node:bench/reporters';
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-cjs">const { json, spec } = require('node:bench/reporters');
</code></pre>
<p>Reporter values can be passed directly to <code>stream.compose()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { bench, run } from 'node:bench';
import { spec } from 'node:bench/reporters';
import process from 'node:process';

bench('example', (b) =&gt; {
  b.start();
  doWork();
  b.end(1);
});

run().compose(spec).pipe(process.stdout);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>spec</code> reporter buffers results and outputs a concise table containing the
sample count, mean rate, 95% confidence interval for the mean, median rate, and
warnings. A coefficient of variation above 5% is reported as <code>noisy</code>, and an
absolute skewness above 1 is reported as <code>skewed</code>. The exact human-readable
format is subject to change.</p>
<p>The <code>json</code> reporter emits every lifecycle record as newline-delimited JSON.
BigInt values, including <code>duration_ns</code>, are encoded as decimal strings. Errors
are represented using their <code>name</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>stack</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>cause</code>, and
<code>errors</code> properties. As required by JSON, non-finite numbers are encoded as
<code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Custom reporters use the same composition contract. They can be transforms or
functions accepted by <code>stream.compose()</code>. The composed readable can be piped to
any writable destination:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { run } from 'node:bench';
import process from 'node:process';

async function* names(source) {
  for await (const { type, data } of source) {
    if (type === 'bench:complete') {
      yield `${data.name}\n`;
    }
  }
}

run().compose(names).pipe(process.stdout);
</code></pre>
<h2><code>createRunner([options])</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>yieldBetweenSamples</code> {boolean} Schedule an event loop turn between sample
callbacks. Disabling this also prevents timer-based abort signals from
firing between synchronous callbacks. Benchmark timeouts continue to be
checked against a monotonic deadline. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {Object} An isolated benchmark runner with bound <code>after</code>, <code>afterEach</code>,
<code>before</code>, <code>beforeEach</code>, <code>bench</code>, <code>describe</code>, <code>run</code>, and <code>suite</code> functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creates an explicitly started benchmark runner. Declarations made through one
runner do not interact with declarations made through another runner or through
the module-level functions. Call the returned <code>run()</code> function to start the
runner and obtain its {BenchmarksStream}.</p>
<p>Each runner can be started once. Its <code>run()</code> function accepts the same options
as the module-level <a href="#runoptions"><code>run()</code></a>. <code>run({ yieldBetweenSamples })</code> overrides the
value passed to <code>createRunner()</code>.</p>
<h2><code>bench([name][, options], fn)</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> {string} The benchmark name. <strong>Default:</strong> The <code>name</code> property of <code>fn</code>,
or <code>'&lt;anonymous&gt;'</code> when <code>fn</code> has no name.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>diagnosticChannels</code> {Array} String diagnostics channel names, deduplicated
and inherited from containing suites by union. Symbol values in the array
are silently ignored. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>[]</code>.</li>
<li><code>only</code> {boolean} When any benchmark or containing suite has <code>only</code> set,
benchmarks without <code>only</code> in their hierarchy are skipped. <strong>Default:</strong>
<code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>params</code> {Object} String, finite number, or boolean metadata identifying
this benchmark configuration. Parameter keys are sorted when constructing
the stable benchmark identity. <strong>Default:</strong> An empty object.</li>
<li><code>samples</code> {number} The maximum number of measured callback invocations.
Must be a positive 32-bit unsigned integer. The benchmark may finish earlier
by calling <code>context.done()</code>. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>30</code>.</li>
<li><code>signal</code> {AbortSignal} Allows aborting this benchmark.</li>
<li><code>skip</code> {boolean|string} If truthy, the benchmark is skipped. A string is
included in the result as the skip reason. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>tags</code> {string[]} Labels associated with the benchmark. Tags are
lowercased, deduplicated, and inherited from containing suites by union.
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>[]</code>.</li>
<li><code>timeout</code> {number} The number of milliseconds after which the benchmark
fails. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>Infinity</code>.</li>
<li><code>warmup</code> {number} The number of unreported callback invocations before
measured samples. Must be a 32-bit unsigned integer. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>fn</code> {Function|AsyncFunction} The benchmark function. It receives a
{BenchContext}.</li>
<li>Returns: {Promise} Fulfilled with the benchmark result after a top-level
benchmark finishes, or with <code>undefined</code> immediately when declared in a
suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warmup invocations use the same callback and timing contract as measured
samples, but their samples are discarded. An exception, rejection, timeout,
abort, missing timing call, or duplicate timing call stops the current
benchmark. Later benchmarks continue to run.</p>
<p>After a timeout or abort, the runner briefly waits for asynchronous benchmark
work to settle before continuing. If it remains pending, all later benchmarks
that were selected to run fail without running so that their measurements
cannot overlap with that work.</p>
<p>For each warmup and measured callback, the runner subscribes to the configured
diagnostics channels. Each publication queues a context diagnostic whose
<code>message</code> is <code>{ name, message }</code>, containing the string channel name and the
published message. Subscriptions are removed when the callback settles or is
aborted.</p>
<p>A timeout or abort cannot interrupt synchronous JavaScript and does not forcibly
cancel asynchronous work that ignores <code>context.signal</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>benchId</code> is based on the declaration source file, hierarchical suite and
benchmark names, and canonicalized parameters. It is stable for repeated runs
from the same source location, but the embedded source value is not normalized
across checkout roots, module formats, operating systems, or path casing.</p>
<p>Execution scope is represented separately. A <code>runId</code> identifies one logical
run, while <code>fileRunId</code> identifies a file runner or child execution within that
run. The <code>entryFile</code> field records which entry-file import caused a declaration
and is <code>null</code> for declarations made by preload modules.
The same <code>benchId</code> can therefore occur under multiple <code>fileRunId</code> values when
entry files use a shared declaration helper. Declaring the same <code>benchId</code> more
than once within one file execution scope reports an error rather than merging
the samples.</p>
<h3><code>bench.skip([name][, options], fn)</code></h3>
<p>Shorthand for <code>bench(name, { ...options, skip: true }, fn)</code>.</p>
<h3><code>bench.only([name][, options], fn)</code></h3>
<p>Shorthand for <code>bench(name, { ...options, only: true }, fn)</code>.</p>
<h2><code>suite([name][, options], fn)</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> {string} The suite name. <strong>Default:</strong> The <code>name</code> property of <code>fn</code>, or
<code>'&lt;anonymous&gt;'</code> when <code>fn</code> has no name.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>diagnosticChannels</code> {Array} String diagnostics channel names inherited by
nested suites and benchmarks. Symbol values in the array are silently
ignored. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>[]</code>.</li>
<li><code>only</code> {boolean} Selects all benchmarks nested in this suite. <strong>Default:</strong>
<code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>skip</code> {boolean|string} Skips all benchmarks nested in this suite.
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>tags</code> {string[]} Labels inherited by nested suites and benchmarks.
<strong>Default:</strong> <code>[]</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>fn</code> {Function|AsyncFunction} A function that declares nested suites,
benchmarks, and hooks.</li>
<li>Returns: {Promise} Fulfilled when a top-level suite finishes, or with
<code>undefined</code> immediately when declared in another suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suite functions run while declarations are collected. Promise-returning suite
functions are awaited before benchmark execution begins.</p>
<h2><code>describe([name][, options], fn)</code></h2>
<p>Alias for <code>suite()</code>.</p>
<h2><code>before(fn)</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code> {Function|AsyncFunction} The hook function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registers a hook that runs once before the benchmarks in the current suite.</p>
<h2><code>after(fn)</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code> {Function|AsyncFunction} The hook function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registers a hook that runs once after the benchmarks in the current suite.</p>
<h2><code>beforeEach(fn)</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code> {Function|AsyncFunction} The hook function. It receives an object with
the benchmark's <code>name</code>, <code>params</code>, and <code>signal</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registers a hook that runs once before each complete logical benchmark in the
current suite. It does not run before every sample. Per-sample setup belongs in
the benchmark function before <code>context.start()</code> or <code>context.record()</code>.</p>
<h2><code>afterEach(fn)</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>fn</code> {Function|AsyncFunction} The hook function. It receives an object with
the benchmark's <code>name</code>, <code>params</code>, and <code>signal</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registers a hook that runs once after each complete logical benchmark in the
current suite. It does not run after every sample. Per-sample cleanup belongs
in the benchmark function after <code>context.end()</code> or <code>context.record()</code>.</p>
<h2><code>run([options])</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>namePattern</code> {string|RegExp} Only runs benchmarks whose full hierarchical
name matches the pattern. String values are interpreted as JavaScript
regular expressions.</li>
<li><code>samples</code> {number} Overrides the maximum number of measured callback
invocations for every benchmark. Must be a positive 32-bit unsigned integer.</li>
<li><code>signal</code> {AbortSignal} Allows aborting in-progress benchmark execution.</li>
<li><code>warmup</code> {number} Overrides the number of unreported warmup callback
invocations for every benchmark. Must be a 32-bit unsigned integer.</li>
<li><code>yieldBetweenSamples</code> {boolean} Schedule an event loop turn between sample
callbacks. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>true</code>, or the value passed to <code>createRunner()</code> for
an explicit runner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {BenchmarksStream}</li>
</ul>
<p>Returns the object-mode event stream for the in-process benchmark run. Call
<code>run()</code> during the same turn in which benchmarks are declared, before automatic
execution begins. Calling <code>run()</code> is optional when the returned stream is not
needed. An explicit runner created by <code>createRunner()</code> does not run
automatically, so its <code>run()</code> function may be called later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-mjs">import { bench, run } from 'node:bench';

bench('example', { samples: 3 }, (b) =&gt; {
  b.start();
  doWork();
  b.end(1);
});

for await (const { type, data } of run()) {
  if (type === 'bench:complete' &amp;&amp; data.error === undefined) {
    console.log(data.name, data.summary.mean);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2><code>runFile(path[, options])</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>path</code> {string|Buffer|URL} The path of one benchmark module.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>env</code> {Object} The child process environment. Property values must be
strings or <code>undefined</code>. This replaces, rather than extends, the parent
environment. <strong>Default:</strong> A snapshot of <code>process.env</code>.</li>
<li><code>execArgv</code> {string[]} Node.js command-line options for the child process.
This replaces, rather than extends, inherited options. Benchmark runner
options, positional arguments, and options that select another execution
mode are not allowed. <strong>Default:</strong> Compatible options inherited from the
current process.</li>
<li><code>signal</code> {AbortSignal} Terminates the child process when aborted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {BenchmarksStream}</li>
</ul>
<p>Runs exactly one benchmark module in a fresh child process and returns its
object-mode event stream. A relative <code>path</code> is resolved from the current working
directory when <code>runFile()</code> is called. <code>path</code> is not interpreted as a glob.
Unless the signal is aborted or the stream is destroyed before startup, every
call uses a new child. Input discovery, ordering, concurrency, retries, and
multi-file scheduling remain the caller's responsibility.</p>
<p>When the Permission Model is enabled, the caller must have file system read
access to <code>path</code> and permission to create child processes.</p>
<p>Records use advanced child process serialization, preserving supported
structured values such as <code>bigint</code> and errors. Child writes to stdout and stderr
become <code>'bench:diagnostic'</code> records. A permission failure, module loading error,
abnormal child exit, or cancellation also emits an error diagnostic and produces
a terminal <code>'bench:summary'</code> whose <code>success</code> property is <code>false</code>; these execution
failures do not error the stream. If module evaluation fails after declaring
benchmarks, those declarations still run before the unsuccessful summary.</p>
<p><code>env</code>, effective inherited options, and an explicitly provided <code>execArgv</code> are
copied when <code>runFile()</code> is called. The runner removes <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code>, replaces
IPC-related environment variables, and sets its private child-context, run
identity, and file identity variables, overriding properties with those names
in <code>env</code>. Pass child Node.js options through <code>execArgv</code>, not <code>NODE_OPTIONS</code>.
Standard <code>child_process</code> environment propagation still applies, including
<code>NODE_V8_COVERAGE</code>, permission-model options, and required z/OS variables.
Aborting <code>signal</code> before the child starts produces an <code>AbortError</code> diagnostic
without spawning it. Aborting during execution sends <code>SIGTERM</code> to the child and
escalates to <code>SIGKILL</code> if it does not exit. Destroying the returned stream
follows the same termination procedure.</p>
<h2>Class: <code>BenchContext</code></h2>
<p>An instance of <code>BenchContext</code> is passed to every benchmark invocation. A new
instance is created for every warmup and measured sample.</p>
<h3><code>context.index</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>{number}</li>
</ul>
<p>The zero-based invocation index within the current <code>context.phase</code>. Warmup and
measured samples have separate index sequences.</p>
<h3><code>context.name</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>{string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The benchmark name.</p>
<h3><code>context.params</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>{Object}</li>
</ul>
<p>The benchmark's canonicalized parameter metadata.</p>
<h3><code>context.phase</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>{string}</li>
</ul>
<p>The current sample phase. It is <code>'warmup'</code> for an unreported warmup invocation
and <code>'measurement'</code> for a measured invocation.</p>
<h3><code>context.signal</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>{AbortSignal}</li>
</ul>
<p>An abort signal that is triggered when the benchmark is aborted, times out, or
finishes.</p>
<h3><code>context.start()</code></h3>
<p>Starts the measured region using <code>process.hrtime.bigint()</code>. Calling <code>start()</code>
more than once is an error.</p>
<h3><code>context.end(operations[, options])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>operations</code> {number} The number of completed operations. Must be a positive
safe integer.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>detail</code> {any} Additional structured-cloneable sample data. With CLI process
isolation, it must also be supported by advanced child process
serialization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {Object} The sample's <code>operations</code>, <code>duration_ns</code>, computed <code>rate</code>,
and optional cloned <code>detail</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ends the measured region. The end timestamp is captured before <code>operations</code> is
validated. Calling <code>end()</code> before <code>start()</code>, calling it more than once, or
recording a zero-duration sample is an error. When provided, <code>detail</code> is cloned
after the end timestamp is captured, so cloning time is outside the measured
region.</p>
<h3><code>context.record(sample)</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>sample</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>operations</code> {number} The number of completed operations. Must be a positive
safe integer.</li>
<li><code>duration_ns</code> {bigint} An externally measured positive duration in
nanoseconds no greater than <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code>.</li>
<li><code>detail</code> {any} Additional structured-cloneable sample data. With CLI process
isolation, it must also be supported by advanced child process
serialization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {Object} The normalized sample, including its computed <code>rate</code> and
optional cloned <code>detail</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Records a measurement made by another clock or execution environment. This is
useful when a higher-level tool measures work in a worker and needs to exclude
message transport from the duration. <code>record()</code> is mutually exclusive with
<code>start()</code> and <code>end()</code> within one callback and must be called exactly once.</p>
<h3><code>context.diagnostic(message[, options])</code></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>message</code> {any} A structured-cloneable diagnostic value. With CLI process
isolation, it must also be supported by advanced child process serialization.</li>
<li><code>options</code> {Object}
<ul>
<li><code>level</code> {string} Either <code>'info'</code> or <code>'warning'</code>. <strong>Default:</strong> <code>'info'</code>.</li>
<li><code>detail</code> {any} Additional structured-cloneable diagnostic data. With CLI
process isolation, it must also be supported by advanced child process
serialization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Returns: {undefined}</li>
</ul>
<p>Queues a diagnostic associated with the current benchmark, phase, and sample
index. Multiple diagnostics preserve call order. They are emitted after the
sample callback settles and before that sample's <code>'bench:sample'</code> event. Warmup
diagnostics are emitted even though warmup samples are not. Diagnostics queued
before a callback failure are emitted before the failed <code>'bench:complete'</code>
event and do not themselves cause the benchmark to fail. If a timeout or abort
wins before the callback settles, queued diagnostics might not be emitted.</p>
<p>The message and detail are cloned synchronously. Options are also validated
synchronously. Calling <code>diagnostic()</code> between <code>context.start()</code> and
<code>context.end()</code> therefore includes that work in the measured duration. Invalid
arguments or an uncloneable message or detail violate the sample contract.</p>
<h3><code>context.done()</code></h3>
<p>Requests successful benchmark completion after the current measured sample.
The callback must still call either <code>start()</code> and <code>end()</code>, or <code>record()</code>.
Calling <code>done()</code> during a warmup invocation is an error. The configured
<code>samples</code> value remains the maximum number of measured invocations if <code>done()</code>
is not called.</p>
<h2>Class: <code>BenchmarksStream</code></h2>
<p><code>BenchmarksStream</code> is an object-mode {stream.Readable}. Each lifecycle record is
both emitted as a named event and made available on the stream as
<code>{ type, data }</code>.</p>
<p>The events are emitted in execution order:</p>

<li><code>'bench:plan'</code></li>
<li><code>'bench:start'</code></li>

<p>Named event payloads, readable records, and benchmark completion values are
independent snapshots. Mutating a value received through one delivery mechanism
does not change values received through the others. As with other
{EventEmitter} events, multiple listeners for the same named event receive the
same event payload. Memory referenced through a {SharedArrayBuffer} remains
shared, following structured clone semantics.</p>
<p>Once a consumer starts reading, the runner honors the stream's object-mode
high-water mark and waits between records when the consumer is slower than the
producer. These waits occur after sample timing has ended, and records are not
dropped. Snapshot creation and delivery waits are excluded from benchmark
timeout accounting. Before readable consumption starts, records accumulate in
the standard readable buffer and are included in <code>readableLength</code>. This keeps an
unread stream and a consumer using only named events from deadlocking, but the
buffer can grow without bound. A named-event-only consumer that does not need
readable records should call <code>stream.resume()</code> to discard them. Destroying the
stream stops readable delivery but does not cancel benchmark execution, so
benchmark completion promises still settle. Automatically scheduled
module-level runs drain their stream internally.</p>
<p>With process isolation, each record sent by a child is acknowledged only after
the parent has accepted it. A child sends no additional record until it receives
that acknowledgement, bounding the IPC relay when a reporter is slow.</p>
<p>Every benchmark-scoped event contains <code>runId</code>, <code>fileRunId</code>, <code>entryFile</code>,
<code>benchId</code>, <code>parentId</code>, and <code>namePath</code>. <code>runId</code> and <code>fileRunId</code> are opaque and
change between runs. <code>entryFile</code> identifies the top-level benchmark file whose
loading caused the declaration, while <code>file</code> identifies the source location of
the declaration itself. <code>parentId</code> is based on the containing suite's source
file and hierarchical name path.</p>
<p>After asynchronous suite declarations settle, an in-process runner emits one
<code>'bench:plan'</code> event for every benchmark it collected, in declaration order.
All plans from that runner are emitted before its suite hooks or benchmark
callbacks run. With process isolation, files run in separate children, so plans
for a later file are emitted after an earlier child has completed. With no
isolation, all files share one runner and their plans are emitted before any
benchmark executes. Plan data contains the benchmark-scoped identity, location,
tags, and parameters described in <a href="#benchmark-result">benchmark result</a>, together with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>diagnosticChannels</code> {string[]} The inherited string channel names
subscribed to during each callback.</li>
<li><code>samples</code> {number} The effective maximum number of measured callback
invocations after run-level overrides.</li>
<li><code>warmup</code> {number} The effective number of unreported warmup callback
invocations after run-level overrides.</li>
<li><code>timeout</code> {number|null} The timeout in milliseconds, or <code>null</code> when no timeout
is configured.</li>
<li><code>yieldBetweenSamples</code> {boolean} Whether an event loop turn is scheduled between
sample callbacks.</li>
<li><code>selected</code> {boolean} Whether the benchmark is eligible to run after applying
<code>skip</code>, <code>only</code>, and <code>namePattern</code> selection. Execution can still be prevented
by a duplicate declaration, suite build, hook, abort, or other runtime failure.</li>
<li><code>skip</code> {boolean|string} When <code>selected</code> is <code>false</code>, the explicit skip value or
the selection reason, such as <code>'only'</code> or <code>'name pattern'</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan contains execution settings known to the runner. Runtime version,
operating system, processor, and other environment metadata are intentionally
left for reporters and higher-level tools to collect.</p>
<p><code>'bench:complete'</code> data contains a <a href="#benchmark-result">benchmark result</a>. A failed result has an
additional <code>error</code> property and may contain samples recorded before the error.
A skipped result has an additional <code>skip</code> property and an empty <code>samples</code>
array. <code>'bench:diagnostic'</code> reports loading, suite, and hook errors as well as
public context diagnostics. A context diagnostic contains the benchmark-scoped
identity fields, <code>phase</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>level</code>, source location, and
optional <code>detail</code>. <code>'bench:summary'</code> contains overall <code>runId</code>, <code>fileRunId</code>,
<code>entryFile</code>, <code>success</code>, <code>counts</code>, <code>duration_ns</code>, and <code>file</code> properties.
<code>fileRunId</code>, <code>entryFile</code>, and <code>file</code> are {string|null}; they are <code>null</code> when the
summary aggregates multiple files.</p>
<h2>Sample result</h2>
<p>Each measured sample has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>operations</code> {number} The positive operation count passed to
<code>context.end()</code> or <code>context.record()</code>.</li>
<li><code>duration_ns</code> {bigint} The measured duration in nanoseconds.</li>
<li><code>rate</code> {number} Operations per second.</li>
<li><code>detail</code> {any} The optional cloned sample detail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benchmark result</h2>
<p>A completed benchmark result contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>runId</code> {string} The opaque logical run identity.</li>
<li><code>fileRunId</code> {string} The opaque file runner or child execution identity.</li>
<li><code>entryFile</code> {string|null} The top-level file that caused this declaration.</li>
<li><code>benchId</code> {string} The stable declaration identity within the same source
