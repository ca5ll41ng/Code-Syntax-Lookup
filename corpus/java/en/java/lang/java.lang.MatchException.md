# MatchException

Thrown to indicate an unexpected failure in pattern matching.

 

`MatchException` may be thrown when an exhaustive pattern matching
 language construct (such as a `switch` expression) encounters a value
 that does not match any of the specified patterns at run time, even though
 the construct has been deemed exhaustive. This is intentional and can arise
 from a number of cases:

 
     
- Separate compilation anomalies, where parts of the type hierarchy that
         the patterns reference have been changed, but the pattern matching
         construct has not been recompiled. For example, if a sealed interface
         has a different set of permitted subtypes at run time than it had at
         compile time, or if an enum class has a different set of enum constants
         at runtime than it had at compile time, or if the type hierarchy has
         been changed in some incompatible way between compile time and run time.

     
- `null` values and nested patterns involving sealed classes. If,
         for example, an interface `I` is `sealed` with two permitted
         subclasses `A` and `B`, and a record class `R` has a
         single component of type `I`, then the two record patterns `R(A a)` and `R(B b)` together are considered to be exhaustive for
         the type `R`, but neither of these patterns will match against the
         result of `new R(null)`.

     
- `null` values and nested record patterns. Given a record class
         `S` with a single component of type `T`, where `T` is
         another record class with a single component of type `String`,
         then the nested record pattern `R(S(var s))` is considered
         exhaustive for the type `R` but it does not match against the
         result of `new R(null)` (whereas it does match against the result
         of `new R(new S(null))` does).
 

 

`MatchException` may also be thrown by the process of pattern matching
 a value against a pattern. For example, pattern matching involving a record
 pattern may require accessor methods to be implicitly invoked in order to
 extract the component values. If any of these accessor methods throws an
 exception, pattern matching completes abruptly and throws `MatchException`. The original exception will be set as a `getCause() cause` of the `MatchException`. No `addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable) suppressed` exceptions will be
 recorded.
