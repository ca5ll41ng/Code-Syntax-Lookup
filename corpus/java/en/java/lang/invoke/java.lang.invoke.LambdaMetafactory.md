# LambdaMetafactory

Methods to facilitate the creation of simple "function objects" that
 implement one or more interfaces by delegation to a provided `MethodHandle`,
 possibly after type adaptation and partial evaluation of arguments.  These
 methods are typically used as bootstrap methods for `invokedynamic`
 call sites, to support the lambda expression and method
 reference expression features of the Java Programming Language.

 

Indirect access to the behavior specified by the provided `MethodHandle`
 proceeds in order through three phases:
 
     
- 

Linkage occurs when the methods in this class are invoked.
     They take as arguments an interface to be implemented (typically a
     functional interface, one with a single abstract method), a
     name and signature of a method from that interface to be implemented, a
     `MethodHandleInfo direct method handle` describing the desired
     implementation behavior for that method, and possibly other additional
     metadata, and produce a `CallSite` whose target can be used to
     create suitable function objects.

     

Linkage may involve dynamically loading a new class that implements
     the target interface, or re-using a suitable existing class.

     

The `CallSite` can be considered a "factory" for function
     objects and so these linkage methods are referred to as
     "metafactories".

     
- 

Capture occurs when the `CallSite`'s target is
     invoked, typically through an `invokedynamic` call site,
     producing a function object. This may occur many times for
     a single factory `CallSite`.

     

If the behavior `MethodHandle` has additional parameters beyond
     those of the specified interface method, these are referred to as
     captured parameters, which must be provided as arguments to the
     `CallSite` target. The expected number and types of captured
     parameters are determined during linkage.

     

Capture may involve allocation of a new function object, or may return
     a suitable existing function object. The identity of a function object
     produced by capture is unpredictable, and therefore identity-sensitive
     operations (such as reference equality, object locking, and `System.identityHashCode()`) may produce different results in different
     implementations, or even upon different invocations in the same
     implementation.

     
- 

Invocation occurs when an implemented interface method is
     invoked on a function object. This may occur many times for a single
     function object. The method referenced by the implementation
     `MethodHandle` is invoked, passing to it the captured arguments and
     the invocation arguments. The result of the method is returned.
     
 

 

It is sometimes useful to restrict the set of inputs or results permitted
 at invocation.  For example, when the generic interface `Predicate`
 is parameterized as `Predicate`, the input must be a
 `String`, even though the method to implement allows any `Object`.
 At linkage time, an additional `MethodType` parameter describes the
 "dynamic" method type; on invocation, the arguments and eventual result
 are checked against this `MethodType`.

 

This class provides two forms of linkage methods: a standard version
 (`metafactory`)
 using an optimized protocol, and an alternate version
 `altMetafactory`).
 The alternate version is a generalization of the standard version, providing
 additional control over the behavior of the generated function objects via
 flags and additional arguments.  The alternate version adds the ability to
 manage the following attributes of function objects:

 
     
- Multiple methods.  It is sometimes useful to implement multiple
     variations of the method signature, involving argument or return type
     adaptation.  This occurs when multiple distinct VM signatures for a method
     are logically considered to be the same method by the language.  The
     flag `FLAG_BRIDGES` indicates that a list of additional
     `MethodType`s will be provided, each of which will be implemented
     by the resulting function object.  These methods will share the same
     name and instantiated type.

     
- Multiple interfaces.  If needed, more than one interface
     can be implemented by the function object.  (These additional interfaces
     are typically marker interfaces with no methods.)  The flag `FLAG_MARKERS`
     indicates that a list of additional interfaces will be provided, each of
     which should be implemented by the resulting function object.

     
- Serializability.  The generated function objects do not
     generally support serialization.  If desired, `FLAG_SERIALIZABLE`
     can be used to indicate that the function objects should be serializable.
     Serializable function objects will use, as their serialized form,
     instances of the class `SerializedLambda`, which requires additional
     assistance from the capturing class (the class described by the
     `MethodHandles.Lookup` parameter `caller`); see
     `SerializedLambda` for details.
 

 

Assume the linkage arguments are as follows:
 
      
- `factoryType` (describing the `CallSite` signature) has
      K parameters of types (D1..Dk) and return type Rd;
      
- `interfaceMethodType` (describing the implemented method type) has N
      parameters, of types (U1..Un) and return type Ru;
      
- `implementation` (the `MethodHandle` providing the
      implementation) has M parameters, of types (A1..Am) and return type Ra
      (if the method describes an instance method, the method type of this
      method handle already includes an extra first argument corresponding to
      the receiver);
      
- `dynamicMethodType` (allowing restrictions on invocation)
      has N parameters, of types (T1..Tn) and return type Rt.
 

 

Then the following linkage invariants must hold:
 
     
- `interfaceMethodType` and `dynamicMethodType` have the same
     arity N, and for i=1..N, Ti and Ui are the same type, or Ti and Ui are
     both reference types and Ti is a subtype of Ui
     
- Either Rt and Ru are the same type, or both are reference types and
     Rt is a subtype of Ru
     
- K + N = M
     
- For i=1..K, Di = Ai
     
- For i=1..N, Ti is adaptable to Aj, where j=i+k
     
- The return type Rt is void, or the return type Ra is not void and is
     adaptable to Rt
 

 

Further, at capture time, if `implementation` corresponds to an instance
 method, and there are any capture arguments (`K > 0`), then the first
 capture argument (corresponding to the receiver) must be non-null.

 

A type Q is considered adaptable to S as follows:
 
   adaptable types
   
     QSLink-time checksInvocation-time checks
   
   
     
         PrimitivePrimitive
         Q can be converted to S via a primitive widening conversion
         None
     
     
         PrimitiveReference
         S is a supertype of the Wrapper(Q)
         Cast from Wrapper(Q) to S
     
     
         ReferencePrimitive
         for parameter types: Q is a primitive wrapper and Primitive(Q)
         can be widened to S
         
for return types: If Q is a primitive wrapper, check that
         Primitive(Q) can be widened to S
         If Q is not a primitive wrapper, cast Q to the base Wrapper(S);
         for example Number for numeric types
     
     
         ReferenceReference
         for parameter types: S is a supertype of Q
         
for return types: none
         Cast from Q to S
     
   
 

 of lambda expressions and method references in the Java
 Language.  For every lambda expressions or method reference in the source code,
 there is a target type which is a functional interface.  Evaluating a lambda
 expression produces an object of its target type. The recommended mechanism
 for evaluating lambda expressions is to desugar the lambda body to a method,
 invoke an invokedynamic call site whose static argument list describes the
 sole method of the functional interface and the desugared implementation
 method, and returns an object (the lambda object) that implements the target
 type. (For method references, the implementation method is simply the
 referenced method; no desugaring is needed.)

 

The argument list of the implementation method and the argument list of
 the interface method(s) may differ in several ways.  The implementation
 methods may have additional arguments to accommodate arguments captured by
 the lambda expression; there may also be differences resulting from permitted
 adaptations of arguments, such as casting, boxing, unboxing, and primitive
 widening. (Varargs adaptations are not handled by the metafactories; these are
 expected to be handled by the caller.)

 

Invokedynamic call sites have two argument lists: a static argument list
 and a dynamic argument list.  The static argument list is stored in the
 constant pool; the dynamic argument is pushed on the operand stack at capture
 time.  The bootstrap method has access to the entire static argument list
 (which in this case, includes information describing the implementation method,
 the target interface, and the target interface method(s)), as well as a
 method signature describing the number and static types (but not the values)
 of the dynamic arguments and the static return type of the invokedynamic site.

 

The implementation method is described with a direct method handle
 referencing a method or constructor. In theory, any method handle could be
 used, but this is not compatible with some implementation techniques and
 would complicate the work implementations must do.

 

Uses besides evaluation of lambda expressions and method references are
 unintended.  These linkage methods may change their unspecified behaviors at
 any time to better suit the Java language features they were designed to
 support, and such changes may impact unintended uses.  Unintended uses of
 these linkage methods may lead to resource leaks, or other unspecified
 negative effects.

 function objects are strongly reachable from the defining class loader of the
 caller, like classes and interfaces in Java source code.  This technique
 reduces heap memory use, but as a consequence, the implementation classes can
 be unloaded only if the caller class can be unloaded.  In particular, if the
 caller is a `STRONG weak hidden
 class`, the implementation class, a strong hidden class, may not be unloaded
 even if the caller may be unloaded.
