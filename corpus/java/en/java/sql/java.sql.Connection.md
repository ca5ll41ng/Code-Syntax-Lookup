# Connection

A connection (session) with a specific
 database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned
 within the context of a connection.
 

 A `Connection` object's database is able to provide information
 describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored
 procedures, the capabilities of this connection, and so on. This
 information is obtained with the `getMetaData` method.

 

**Note:** When configuring a `Connection`, JDBC applications
  should use the appropriate `Connection` method such as
  `setAutoCommit` or `setTransactionIsolation`.
  Applications should not invoke SQL commands directly to change the connection's
  configuration when there is a JDBC method available.  By default, a `Connection`
  object is in auto-commit mode, which means that it automatically commits changes
 after executing each statement. If auto-commit mode has been
 disabled, the method `commit` must be called explicitly in
 order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved.
 

 A new `Connection` object created using the JDBC 2.1 core API
 has an initially empty type map associated with it. A user may enter a
 custom mapping for a UDT in this type map.
 When a UDT is retrieved from a data source with the
 method `ResultSet.getObject`, the `getObject` method
 will check the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for that
 UDT.  If so, the `getObject` method will map the UDT to the
 class indicated.  If there is no entry, the UDT will be mapped using the
 standard mapping.
 

 A user may create a new type map, which is a `java.util.Map`
 object, make an entry in it, and pass it to the `java.sql`
 methods that can perform custom mapping.  In this case, the method
 will use the given type map instead of the one associated with
 the connection.
 

 For example, the following code fragment specifies that the SQL
 type `ATHLETES` will be mapped to the class
 `Athletes` in the Java programming language.
 The code fragment retrieves the type map for the `Connection
 ` object `con`, inserts the entry into it, and then sets
 the type map with the new entry as the connection's type map.
 
```

      java.util.Map map = con.getTypeMap();
      map.put("mySchemaName.ATHLETES", Class.forName("Athletes"));
      con.setTypeMap(map);
 
```
