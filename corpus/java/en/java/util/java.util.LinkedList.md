# LinkedList

Doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` and `Deque`
 interfaces.  Implements all optional list operations, and permits all
 elements (including `null`).

 

All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked
 list.  Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from
 the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.

 

**Note that this implementation is not synchronized.**
 If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least
 one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be
 synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation
 that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of
 an element is not a structural modification.)  This is typically
 accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally
 encapsulates the list.

 If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
 `synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList`
 method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 unsynchronized access to the list:
```

   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));
```

 

The iterators returned by this class's `iterator` and
 `listIterator` methods are fail-fast: if the list is
 structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in
 any way except through the Iterator's own `remove` or
 `add` methods, the iterator will throw a `ConcurrentModificationException`.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than
 risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
 time in the future.

 

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 throw `ConcurrentModificationException` on a best-effort basis.
 Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 exception for its correctness:   the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 should be used only to detect bugs.

 

This class is a member of the
 
 Java Collections Framework.
