# ResourceBundleProvider

`ResourceBundleProvider` is a service provider interface for
 resource bundles. It is used by
 `getBundle(String) ResourceBundle.getBundle`
 factory methods to locate and load the service providers that are deployed as
 modules via `java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader`.

 Developing resource bundle services

 A service for a resource bundle of a given `baseName` must have
 a fully-qualified class name of the form:
 
 ` + ".spi." +  + "Provider"`
 

 The service type is in a `spi` subpackage as it may be packaged in
 a module separate from the resource bundle providers.
 For example, the service for a resource bundle named
 `com.example.app.MyResources` must be
 `com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider`:

 
```

 `package com.example.app.spi;
 public interface MyResourcesProvider extends ResourceBundleProvider {
 `
 }
```

 Deploying resource bundle service providers

 Resource bundles can be deployed in one or more service providers
 in modules.  For example, a provider for a service
 named "`com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider`"
 has the following implementation class:

 
```

 `import com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider;
 class MyResourcesProviderImpl extends AbstractResourceBundleProvider
     implements MyResourcesProvider
 {
     public MyResourcesProviderImpl() {
         super("java.properties");
     `
     // this provider maps the resource bundle to per-language package
     protected String toBundleName(String baseName, Locale locale) {
         return "p." + locale.getLanguage() + "." + baseName;
     }

     public ResourceBundle getBundle(String baseName, Locale locale) {
         // this module only provides bundles in French
         if (locale.equals(Locale.FRENCH)) {
              return super.getBundle(baseName, locale);
         }
         // otherwise return null
         return null;
     }
 }}
```

 This example provides "`com.example.app.MyResources`"
 resource bundle of the French locale.  Traditionally resource bundles of
 all locales are packaged in the same package as the resource bundle base name.
 When deploying resource bundles in more than one modules and two modules
 containing a package of the same name, split package,
 is not supported, resource bundles in each module can be packaged in
 a different package as shown in this example where this provider packages
 the resource bundles in per-language package, i.e. `com.example.app.fr`
 for French locale.

 

 A provider can provide more than one services, each of which is a service
 for a resource bundle of a different base name.

 

`AbstractResourceBundleProvider`
 provides the basic implementation for `ResourceBundleProvider`
 and a subclass can override the `toBundleName(String, Locale) toBundleName`
 method to return a provider-specific location of the resource to be loaded,
 for example, per-language package.
 A provider can override `getBundle ResourceBundleProvider.getBundle`
 method for example to only search the known supported locales or
 return resource bundles in other formats such as XML.

 

The module declaration of this provider module specifies the following
 directive:
 
```

     provides com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider with com.example.impl.MyResourcesProviderImpl;
 
```

 Obtaining resource bundles from providers

 The module declaration of the consumer module that calls one of the
 `ResourceBundle.getBundle` factory methods to obtain a resource
 bundle from service providers must specify the following directive:
 
```

     uses com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider;
 
```

 `getBundle(String, Locale)
 ResourceBundle.getBundle`
 locates and loads the providers for `com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider`
 service and then invokes `getBundle(String, Locale)
 ResourceBundleProvider.getBundle` to
 find the resource bundle of the given base name and locale.
 If the consumer module is a resource bundle service provider for
 `com.example.app.spi.MyResourcesProvider`, `ResourceBundle.getBundle`
 will locate resource bundles only from service providers.
 Otherwise, `ResourceBundle.getBundle` may continue the search of
 the resource bundle in other modules and class path per the specification
 of the `ResourceBundle.getBundle` method being called.
