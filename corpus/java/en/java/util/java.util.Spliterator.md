# Spliterator

An object for traversing and partitioning elements of a source.  The source
 of elements covered by a Spliterator could be, for example, an array, a
 `Collection`, an IO channel, or a generator function.

 

A Spliterator may traverse elements individually (`tryAdvance tryAdvance`) or sequentially in bulk
 (`forEachRemaining forEachRemaining`).

 

A Spliterator may also partition off some of its elements (using
 `trySplit`) as another Spliterator, to be used in
 possibly-parallel operations.  Operations using a Spliterator that
 cannot split, or does so in a highly imbalanced or inefficient
 manner, are unlikely to benefit from parallelism.  Traversal
 and splitting exhaust elements; each Spliterator is useful for only a single
 bulk computation.

 

A Spliterator also reports a set of `characteristics` of its
 structure, source, and elements from among `ORDERED`,
 `DISTINCT`, `SORTED`, `SIZED`, `NONNULL`,
 `IMMUTABLE`, `CONCURRENT`, and `SUBSIZED`. These may
 be employed by Spliterator clients to control, specialize or simplify
 computation.  For example, a Spliterator for a `Collection` would
 report `SIZED`, a Spliterator for a `Set` would report
 `DISTINCT`, and a Spliterator for a `SortedSet` would also
 report `SORTED`.  Characteristics are reported as a simple unioned bit
 set.

 Some characteristics additionally constrain method behavior; for example if
 `ORDERED`, traversal methods must conform to their documented ordering.
 New characteristics may be defined in the future, so implementors should not
 assign meanings to unlisted values.

 

A Spliterator that does not report `IMMUTABLE` or
 `CONCURRENT` is expected to have a documented policy concerning:
 when the spliterator binds to the element source; and detection of
 structural interference of the element source detected after binding.  A
 late-binding Spliterator binds to the source of elements at the
 point of first traversal, first split, or first query for estimated size,
 rather than at the time the Spliterator is created.  A Spliterator that is
 not late-binding binds to the source of elements at the point of
 construction or first invocation of any method.  Modifications made to the
 source prior to binding are reflected when the Spliterator is traversed.
 After binding a Spliterator should, on a best-effort basis, throw
 `ConcurrentModificationException` if structural interference is
 detected.  Spliterators that do this are called fail-fast.  The
 bulk traversal method (`forEachRemaining forEachRemaining`) of a
 Spliterator may optimize traversal and check for structural interference
 after all elements have been traversed, rather than checking per-element and
 failing immediately.

 

Spliterators can provide an estimate of the number of remaining elements
 via the `estimateSize` method.  Ideally, as reflected in characteristic
 `SIZED`, this value corresponds exactly to the number of elements
 that would be encountered in a successful traversal.  However, even when not
 exactly known, an estimated value may still be useful to operations
 being performed on the source, such as helping to determine whether it is
 preferable to split further or traverse the remaining elements sequentially.

 

Despite their obvious utility in parallel algorithms, spliterators are not
 expected to be thread-safe; instead, implementations of parallel algorithms
 using spliterators should ensure that the spliterator is only used by one
 thread at a time.  This is generally easy to attain via serial
 thread-confinement, which often is a natural consequence of typical
 parallel algorithms that work by recursive decomposition.  A thread calling
 `trySplit` may hand over the returned Spliterator to another thread,
 which in turn may traverse or further split that Spliterator.  The behaviour
 of splitting and traversal is undefined if two or more threads operate
 concurrently on the same spliterator.  If the original thread hands a
 spliterator off to another thread for processing, it is best if that handoff
 occurs before any elements are consumed with `tryAdvance(Consumer)
 tryAdvance`, as certain guarantees (such as the accuracy of
 `estimateSize` for `SIZED` spliterators) are only valid before
 traversal has begun.

 

Primitive subtype specializations of `Spliterator` are provided for
 `OfInt int`, `OfLong long`, and `OfDouble double` values.
 The subtype default implementations of
 `tryAdvance`
 and `forEachRemaining` box
 primitive values to instances of their corresponding wrapper class.  Such
 boxing may undermine any performance advantages gained by using the primitive
 specializations.  To avoid boxing, the corresponding primitive-based methods
 should be used.  For example,
 `tryAdvance`
 and `forEachRemaining`
 should be used in preference to
 `tryAdvance` and
 `forEachRemaining`.
 Traversal of primitive values using boxing-based methods
 `tryAdvance tryAdvance` and
 `forEachRemaining`
 does not affect the order in which the values, transformed to boxed values,
 are encountered.

 

Spliterators, like `Iterator`s, are for traversing the elements of
 a source.  The `Spliterator` API was designed to support efficient
 parallel traversal in addition to sequential traversal, by supporting
 decomposition as well as single-element iteration.  In addition, the
 protocol for accessing elements via a Spliterator is designed to impose
 smaller per-element overhead than `Iterator`, and to avoid the inherent
 race involved in having separate methods for `hasNext()` and
 `next()`.

 

For mutable sources, arbitrary and non-deterministic behavior may occur if
 the source is structurally interfered with (elements added, replaced, or
 removed) between the time that the Spliterator binds to its data source and
 the end of traversal.  For example, such interference will produce arbitrary,
 non-deterministic results when using the `java.util.stream` framework.

 

Structural interference of a source can be managed in the following ways
 (in approximate order of decreasing desirability):
 
 
- The source cannot be structurally interfered with.
 
For example, an instance of
 `java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList` is an immutable source.
 A Spliterator created from the source reports a characteristic of
 `IMMUTABLE`.
 
- The source manages concurrent modifications.
 
For example, a key set of a `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`
 is a concurrent source.  A Spliterator created from the source reports a
 characteristic of `CONCURRENT`.
 
- The mutable source provides a late-binding and fail-fast Spliterator.
 
Late binding narrows the window during which interference can affect
 the calculation; fail-fast detects, on a best-effort basis, that structural
 interference has occurred after traversal has commenced and throws
 `ConcurrentModificationException`.  For example, `ArrayList`,
 and many other non-concurrent `Collection` classes in the JDK, provide
 a late-binding, fail-fast spliterator.
 
- The mutable source provides a non-late-binding but fail-fast Spliterator.
 
The source increases the likelihood of throwing
 `ConcurrentModificationException` since the window of potential
 interference is larger.
 
- The mutable source provides a late-binding and non-fail-fast Spliterator.
 
The source risks arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior after traversal
 has commenced since interference is not detected.
 
 
- The mutable source provides a non-late-binding and non-fail-fast
 Spliterator.
 
The source increases the risk of arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior
 since non-detected interference may occur after construction.
 
 

 

**Example.** Here is a class (not a very useful one, except
 for illustration) that maintains an array in which the actual data
 are held in even locations, and unrelated tag data are held in odd
 locations. Its Spliterator ignores the tags.

 
```
 `class TaggedArray {
   private final Object[] elements; // immutable after construction
   TaggedArray(T[] data, Object[] tags) {
     int size = data.length;
     if (tags.length != size) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
     this.elements = new Object[2 * size];
     for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < size; ++i) {
       elements[j++] = data[i];
       elements[j++] = tags[i];
     `
   }

   public Spliterator spliterator() {
     return new TaggedArraySpliterator<>(elements, 0, elements.length);
   }

   static class TaggedArraySpliterator implements Spliterator {
     private final Object[] array;
     private int origin; // current index, advanced on split or traversal
     private final int fence; // one past the greatest index

     TaggedArraySpliterator(Object[] array, int origin, int fence) {
       this.array = array; this.origin = origin; this.fence = fence;
     }

     public void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super T> action) {
       for (; origin < fence; origin += 2)
         action.accept((T) array[origin]);
     }

     public boolean tryAdvance(Consumer<? super T> action) {
       if (origin < fence) {
         action.accept((T) array[origin]);
         origin += 2;
         return true;
       }
       else // cannot advance
         return false;
     }

     public Spliterator trySplit() {
       int lo = origin; // divide range in half
       int mid = ((lo + fence) >>> 1) & ~1; // force midpoint to be even
       if (lo < mid) { // split out left half
         origin = mid; // reset this Spliterator's origin
         return new TaggedArraySpliterator<>(array, lo, mid);
       }
       else       // too small to split
         return null;
     }

     public long estimateSize() {
       return (long)((fence - origin) / 2);
     }

     public int characteristics() {
       return ORDERED | SIZED | IMMUTABLE | SUBSIZED;
     }
   }
 }}
```

 

As an example how a parallel computation framework, such as the
 `java.util.stream` package, would use Spliterator in a parallel
 computation, here is one way to implement an associated parallel forEach,
 that illustrates the primary usage idiom of splitting off subtasks until
 the estimated amount of work is small enough to perform
 sequentially. Here we assume that the order of processing across
 subtasks doesn't matter; different (forked) tasks may further split
 and process elements concurrently in undetermined order.  This
 example uses a `java.util.concurrent.CountedCompleter`;
 similar usages apply to other parallel task constructions.

 
```
`static  void parEach(TaggedArray a, Consumer action) {
   Spliterator s = a.spliterator();
   long targetBatchSize = s.estimateSize() / (ForkJoinPool.getCommonPoolParallelism() * 8);
   new ParEach(null, s, action, targetBatchSize).invoke();
 `

 static class ParEach extends CountedCompleter {
   final Spliterator spliterator;
   final Consumer action;
   final long targetBatchSize;

   ParEach(ParEach parent, Spliterator spliterator,
           Consumer action, long targetBatchSize) {
     super(parent);
     this.spliterator = spliterator; this.action = action;
     this.targetBatchSize = targetBatchSize;
   }

   public void compute() {
     Spliterator sub;
     while (spliterator.estimateSize() > targetBatchSize &&
            (sub = spliterator.trySplit()) != null) {
       addToPendingCount(1);
       new ParEach<>(this, sub, action, targetBatchSize).fork();
     }
     spliterator.forEachRemaining(action);
     propagateCompletion();
   }
 }}
```

 If the boolean system property {@systemProperty org.openjdk.java.util.stream.tripwire}
 is set to `true` then diagnostic warnings are reported if boxing of
 primitive values occur when operating on primitive subtype specializations.
