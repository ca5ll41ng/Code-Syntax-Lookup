# BlockingQueue

A `Queue` that additionally supports operations that wait for
 the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait
 for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.

 

`BlockingQueue` methods come in four forms, with different ways
 of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be
 satisfied at some point in the future:
 one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either
 `null` or `false`, depending on the operation), the third
 blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,
 and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving
 up.  These methods are summarized in the following table:

 
 Summary of BlockingQueue methods
  
    
    Throws exception
    Special value
    Blocks
    Times out
  
  
    Insert
    `add`
    `offer`
    `put`
    `offer`
  
  
    Remove
    `remove`
    `poll`
    `take`
    `poll`
  
  
    Examine
    `element`
    `peek`
    not applicable
    not applicable
  
 

 

A `BlockingQueue` does not accept `null` elements.
 Implementations throw `NullPointerException` on attempts
 to `add`, `put` or `offer` a `null`.  A
 `null` is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
 `poll` operations.

 

A `BlockingQueue` may be capacity bounded. At any given
 time it may have a `remainingCapacity` beyond which no
 additional elements can be `put` without blocking.
 A `BlockingQueue` without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
 reports a remaining capacity of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

 

`BlockingQueue` implementations are designed to be used
 primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
 the `Collection` interface.  So, for example, it is
 possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using
 `remove(x)`. However, such operations are in general
 not performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
 occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.

 

`BlockingQueue` implementations are thread-safe.  All
 queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
 locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the
 bulk Collection operations `addAll`,
 `containsAll`, `retainAll` and `removeAll` are
 not necessarily performed atomically unless specified
 otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for
 `addAll(c)` to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
 only some of the elements in `c`.

 

A `BlockingQueue` does not intrinsically support
 any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to
 indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
 such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
 common tactic is for producers to insert special
 end-of-stream or poison objects, that are
 interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.

 

 Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
 Note that a `BlockingQueue` can safely be used with multiple
 producers and multiple consumers.
 
```
 `class Producer implements Runnable {
   private final BlockingQueue queue;
   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; `
   public void run() {
     try {
       while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }
     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
   }
   Object produce() { ... }
 }

 class Consumer implements Runnable {
   private final BlockingQueue queue;
   Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
   public void run() {
     try {
       while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }
     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
   }
   void consume(Object x) { ... }
 }

 class Setup {
   void main() {
     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
     Producer p = new Producer(q);
     Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);
     Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q);
     new Thread(p).start();
     new Thread(c1).start();
     new Thread(c2).start();
   }
 }}
```

 

Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
 collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 `BlockingQueue`
 happen-before
 actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
 the `BlockingQueue` in another thread.

 

This interface is a member of the
 
 Java Collections Framework.
