# Flow

Interrelated interfaces and static methods for establishing
 flow-controlled components in which `Publisher Publishers`
 produce items consumed by one or more `Subscriber
 Subscribers`, each managed by a `Subscription
 Subscription`.

 

These interfaces correspond to the  reactive-streams
 specification.  They apply in both concurrent and distributed
 asynchronous settings: All (seven) methods are defined in `void` "one-way" message style. Communication relies on a simple form
 of flow control (method `request`) that can be
 used to avoid resource management problems that may otherwise occur
 in "push" based systems.

 

**Examples.** A `Publisher` usually defines its own
 `Subscription` implementation; constructing one in method
 `subscribe` and issuing it to the calling `Subscriber`. It publishes items to the subscriber asynchronously,
 normally using an `Executor`.  For example, here is a very
 simple publisher that only issues (when requested) a single `TRUE` item to a single subscriber.  Because the subscriber receives
 only a single item, this class does not use buffering and ordering
 control required in most implementations (for example `SubmissionPublisher`), and omits some error processing needed to
 fully conform to the Reactive Streams specification.

 
```
 `class OneShotPublisher implements Publisher {
   private final ExecutorService executor = ForkJoinPool.commonPool(); // daemon-based
   private boolean subscribed; // true after first subscribe
   public synchronized void subscribe(Subscriber<? super Boolean> subscriber) {
     if (subscribed)
       subscriber.onError(new IllegalStateException()); // only one allowed
     else {
       subscribed = true;
       subscriber.onSubscribe(new OneShotSubscription(subscriber, executor));
     `
   }
   static class OneShotSubscription implements Subscription {
     private final Subscriber<? super Boolean> subscriber;
     private final ExecutorService executor;
     private Future<?> future; // to allow cancellation
     private boolean completed;
     OneShotSubscription(Subscriber<? super Boolean> subscriber,
                         ExecutorService executor) {
       this.subscriber = subscriber;
       this.executor = executor;
     }
     public synchronized void request(long n) {
       if (!completed) {
         completed = true;
         if (n <= 0) {
           IllegalArgumentException ex = new IllegalArgumentException();
           executor.execute(() -> subscriber.onError(ex));
         } else {
           future = executor.submit(() -> {
             subscriber.onNext(Boolean.TRUE);
             subscriber.onComplete();
           });
         }
       }
     }
     public synchronized void cancel() {
       completed = true;
       if (future != null) future.cancel(false);
     }
   }
 }}
```

 

A `Subscriber` arranges that items be requested and
 processed.  Items (invocations of `onNext`) are
 not issued unless requested, but multiple items may be requested.
 Many Subscriber implementations can arrange this in the style of
 the following example, where a buffer size of 1 single-steps, and
 larger sizes usually allow for more efficient overlapped processing
 with less communication; for example with a value of 64, this keeps
 total outstanding requests between 32 and 64.
 Because Subscriber method invocations for a given `Subscription` are strictly ordered, there is no need for these
 methods to use locks or volatiles unless a Subscriber maintains
 multiple Subscriptions (in which case it is better to instead
 define multiple Subscribers, each with its own Subscription).

 
```
 `class SampleSubscriber implements Subscriber {
   final Consumer<? super T> consumer;
   Subscription subscription;
   final long bufferSize;
   long count;
   SampleSubscriber(long bufferSize, Consumer<? super T> consumer) {
     this.bufferSize = bufferSize;
     this.consumer = consumer;
   `
   public void onSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
     long initialRequestSize = bufferSize;
     count = bufferSize - bufferSize / 2; // re-request when half consumed
     (this.subscription = subscription).request(initialRequestSize);
   }
   public void onNext(T item) {
     if (--count <= 0)
       subscription.request(count = bufferSize - bufferSize / 2);
     consumer.accept(item);
   }
   public void onError(Throwable ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); }
   public void onComplete() {}
 }}
```

 

The default value of `defaultBufferSize` may provide a
 useful starting point for choosing request sizes and capacities in
 Flow components based on expected rates, resources, and usages.
 Or, when flow control is never needed, a subscriber may initially
 request an effectively unbounded number of items, as in:

 
```
 `class UnboundedSubscriber implements Subscriber {
   public void onSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
     subscription.request(Long.MAX_VALUE); // effectively unbounded
   `
   public void onNext(T item) { use(item); }
   public void onError(Throwable ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); }
   public void onComplete() {}
   void use(T item) { ... }
 }}
```
