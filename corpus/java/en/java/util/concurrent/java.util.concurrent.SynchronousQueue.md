# SynchronousQueue

A `BlockingQueue blocking queue` in which each insert
 operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another
 thread, and vice versa.  A synchronous queue does not have any
 internal capacity, not even a capacity of one.  You cannot
 `peek` at a synchronous queue because an element is only
 present when you try to remove it; you cannot insert an element
 (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it;
 you cannot iterate as there is nothing to iterate.  The
 head of the queue is the element that the first queued
 inserting thread is trying to add to the queue; if there is no such
 queued thread then no element is available for removal and
 `poll()` will return `null`.  For purposes of other
 `Collection` methods (for example `contains`), a
 `SynchronousQueue` acts as an empty collection.  This queue
 does not permit `null` elements.

 

Synchronous queues are similar to rendezvous channels used in
 CSP and Ada. They are well suited for handoff designs, in which an
 object running in one thread must sync up with an object running
 in another thread in order to hand it some information, event, or
 task.

 

This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
 waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
 is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
 to `true` grants threads access in FIFO order.

 

This class and its iterator implement all of the optional
 methods of the `Collection` and `Iterator` interfaces.

 

This class is a member of the
 
 Java Collections Framework.
