# DateTimeFormatter

Formatter for printing and parsing date-time objects.
 

 This class provides the main application entry point for printing and parsing
 and provides common implementations of `DateTimeFormatter`:
 
 
- Using predefined constants, such as `ISO_LOCAL_DATE`
 
- Using pattern letters, such as `uuuu-MMM-dd`
 
- Using localized styles, such as `long` or `medium`
 

 

 More complex formatters are provided by
 `DateTimeFormatterBuilder DateTimeFormatterBuilder`.

 

 The main date-time classes provide two methods - one for formatting,
 `format(DateTimeFormatter formatter)`, and one for parsing,
 `parse(CharSequence text, DateTimeFormatter formatter)`.
 

For example:
 
```

  LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
  String text = date.format(formatter);
  LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);
 
```

 

 In addition to the format, formatters can be created with desired Locale,
 Chronology, ZoneId, and DecimalStyle.
 

 The `withLocale withLocale` method returns a new formatter that
 overrides the locale. The locale affects some aspects of formatting and
 parsing. For example, the `ofLocalizedDate ofLocalizedDate` provides a
 formatter that uses the locale specific date format.
 

 The `withChronology withChronology` method returns a new formatter
 that overrides the chronology. If overridden, the date-time value is
 converted to the chronology before formatting. During parsing the date-time
 value is converted to the chronology before it is returned.
 

 The `withZone withZone` method returns a new formatter that overrides
 the zone. If overridden, the date-time value is converted to a ZonedDateTime
 with the requested ZoneId before formatting. During parsing the ZoneId is
 applied before the value is returned.
 

 The `withDecimalStyle withDecimalStyle` method returns a new formatter that
 overrides the `DecimalStyle`. The DecimalStyle symbols are used for
 formatting and parsing.
 

 Some applications may need to use the older `Format java.text.Format`
 class for formatting. The `toFormat` method returns an
 implementation of `java.text.Format`.

 Patterns for Formatting and Parsing
 Patterns are based on a simple sequence of letters and symbols.
 A pattern is used to create a Formatter using the
 `ofPattern` and `ofPattern` methods.
 For example,
 `"d MMM uuuu"` will format 2011-12-03 as '3&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2011'.
 A formatter created from a pattern can be used as many times as necessary,
 it is immutable and is thread-safe.
 

 For example:
 
```

  LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
  DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy MM dd");
  String text = date.format(formatter);
  LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);
 
```

 

 All letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' are reserved as pattern letters. The
 following pattern letters are defined:

 The count of pattern letters determines the format.
 

 **Text**: The text style is determined based on the number of pattern
 letters used. Less than 4 pattern letters will use the
 `SHORT short form`. Exactly 4 pattern letters will use the
 `FULL full form`. Exactly 5 pattern letters will use the
 `NARROW narrow form`.
 Pattern letters 'L', 'c', and 'q' specify the stand-alone form of the text styles.
 

 **Number**: If the count of letters is one, then the value is output using
 the minimum number of digits and without padding. Otherwise, the count of digits
 is used as the width of the output field, with the value zero-padded as necessary.
 The following pattern letters have constraints on the count of letters.
 Only one letter of 'c' and 'F' can be specified.
 Up to two letters of 'd', 'H', 'h', 'K', 'k', 'm', and 's' can be specified.
 Up to three letters of 'D' can be specified.
 

 **Number/Text**: If the count of pattern letters is 3 or greater, use the
 Text rules above. Otherwise use the Number rules above.
 

 **Fraction**: Outputs the nano-of-second field as a fraction-of-second.
 The nano-of-second value has nine digits, thus the count of pattern letters
 is from 1 to 9. If it is less than 9, then the nano-of-second value is
 truncated, with only the most significant digits being output.
 

 **Year**: The count of letters determines the minimum field width below
 which padding is used. If the count of letters is two, then a
 `appendValueReduced reduced` two digit form is
 used. For printing, this outputs the rightmost two digits. For parsing, this
 will parse using the base value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range
 2000 to 2099 inclusive. If the count of letters is less than four (but not
 two), then the sign is only output for negative years as per
 `NORMAL`. Otherwise, the sign is output if the pad width is
 exceeded, as per `EXCEEDS_PAD`.
 

 **ZoneId**: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'. If the
 count of letters is two, then the time-zone ID is output. Any other count of
 letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.
 

 **Zone names**: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID. If the
 pattern letter is 'z' the output is the daylight saving aware zone name.
 If there is insufficient information to determine whether DST applies,
 the name ignoring daylight saving time will be used.
 If the count of letters is one, two or three, then the short name is output.
 If the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.
 Five or more letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.
 

 If the pattern letter is 'v' the output provides the zone name ignoring
 daylight saving time. If the count of letters is one, then the short name is output.
 If the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.
 Two, three and five or more letters throw `IllegalArgumentException`.
 

 **Offset X and x**: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
 letters. One letter outputs just the hour, such as '+01', unless the minute
 is non-zero in which case the minute is also output, such as '+0130'. Two
 letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'. Three
 letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as '+01:30'. Four
 letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon,
 such as '+013015'. Five letters outputs the hour and minute and optional
 second, with a colon, such as '+01:30:15'. Six or more letters throws
 `IllegalArgumentException`. Pattern letter 'X' (upper case) will output
 'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero, whereas pattern letter 'x'
 (lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'.
 

 **Offset O**: With a non-zero offset, this formats the localized offset
 based on the number of pattern letters. One letter outputs the
 `SHORT short` form of the localized offset, which is
 localized offset text, such as 'GMT', with hour without leading zero, optional
 2-digit minute and second if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+8'. Four
 letters outputs the `FULL full` form, which is localized
 offset text, such as 'GMT, with 2-digit hour and minute field, optional second
 field if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+08:00'. If the offset is zero,
 only localized text is output. Any other count of letters throws
 `IllegalArgumentException`.
 

 **Offset Z**: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
 letters. One, two or three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a
 colon, such as '+0130'. The output will be '+0000' when the offset is zero.
 Four letters outputs the `FULL full` form of localized
 offset, equivalent to four letters of Offset-O. The output will be the
 corresponding localized offset text if the offset is zero. Five
 letters outputs the hour, minute, with optional second if non-zero, with
 colon. It outputs 'Z' if the offset is zero.
 Six or more letters throws `IllegalArgumentException`.
 

 **Optional section**: The optional section markers work exactly like
 calling `optionalStart` and
 `optionalEnd`.
 

 **Pad modifier**: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be
 padded with spaces. The pad width is determined by the number of pattern
 letters. This is the same as calling
 `padNext`.
 

 For example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to
 a width of 2.
 

 Any unrecognized letter is an error. Any non-letter character, other than
 '[', ']', '{', '}', '#' and the single quote will be output directly.
 Despite this, it is recommended to use single quotes around all characters
 that you want to output directly to ensure that future changes do not break
 your application.

 Resolving
 Parsing is implemented as a two-phase operation.
 First, the text is parsed using the layout defined by the formatter, producing
 a `Map` of field to value, a `ZoneId` and a `Chronology`.
 Second, the parsed data is resolved, by validating, combining and
 simplifying the various fields into more useful ones.
 

 Five parsing methods are supplied by this class.
 Four of these perform both the parse and resolve phases.
 The fifth method, `parseUnresolved`,
 only performs the first phase, leaving the result unresolved.
 As such, it is essentially a low-level operation.
 

 The resolve phase is controlled by two parameters, set on this class.
 

 The `ResolverStyle` is an enum that offers three different approaches,
 strict, smart and lenient. The smart option is the default.
 It can be set using `withResolverStyle`.
 

 The `withResolverFields` parameter allows the
 set of fields that will be resolved to be filtered before resolving starts.
 For example, if the formatter has parsed a year, month, day-of-month
 and day-of-year, then there are two approaches to resolve a date:
 (year + month + day-of-month) and (year + day-of-year).
 The resolver fields allows one of the two approaches to be selected.
 If no resolver fields are set then both approaches must result in the same date.
 

 Resolving separate fields to form a complete date and time is a complex
 process with behaviour distributed across a number of classes.
 It follows these steps:
 
 
- The chronology is determined.
 The chronology of the result is either the chronology that was parsed,
 or if no chronology was parsed, it is the chronology set on this class,
 or if that is null, it is `IsoChronology`.
 
- The `ChronoField` date fields are resolved.
 This is achieved using `resolveDate`.
 Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation
 of `Chronology`.
 
- The `ChronoField` time fields are resolved.
 This is documented on `ChronoField` and is the same for all chronologies.
 
- Any fields that are not `ChronoField` are processed.
 This is achieved using `resolve`.
 Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation
 of `TemporalField`.
 
- The `ChronoField` date and time fields are re-resolved.
 This allows fields in step four to produce `ChronoField` values
 and have them be processed into dates and times.
 
- A `LocalTime` is formed if there is at least an hour-of-day available.
 This involves providing default values for minute, second and fraction of second.
 
- Any remaining unresolved fields are cross-checked against any
 date and/or time that was resolved. Thus, an earlier stage would resolve
 (year + month + day-of-month) to a date, and this stage would check that
 day-of-week was valid for the date.
 
- If an `parsedExcessDays() excess number of days`
 was parsed then it is added to the date if a date is available.
 
-  If a second-based field is present, but `LocalTime` was not parsed,
 then the resolver ensures that milli, micro and nano second values are
 available to meet the contract of `ChronoField`.
 These will be set to zero if missing.
 
- If both date and time were parsed and either an offset or zone is present,
 the field `INSTANT_SECONDS` is created.
 If an offset was parsed then the offset will be combined with the
 `LocalDateTime` to form the instant, with any zone ignored.
 If a `ZoneId` was parsed without an offset then the zone will be
 combined with the `LocalDateTime` to form the instant using the rules
 of `atZone`. If the `ZoneId` was
 parsed from a zone name that indicates whether daylight saving time is in
 operation or not, then that fact will be used to select the correct offset
 at the local time-line overlap.
 

 This class is immutable and thread-safe.
