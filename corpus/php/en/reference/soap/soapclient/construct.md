# SoapClient constructor

## Description

```php
public SoapClient::__construct(string|null $wsdl, array $options = [])
```

Creates a `SoapClient` object to connect to a SOAP service.

## Parameters

- **`$wsdl`** — URI of a WSDL file describing the service, which is used to automatically configure the client. If not provided, the client will operate in non-WSDL mode.
  > By default, the WSDL file will be cached for performance. To disable or configure this caching, see SOAP  and the `cache_wsdl` option.


- **`$options`** — An associative array specifying additional options for the SOAP client. If `$wsdl` is provided, this is optional; otherwise, at least `location` and `url` must be provided. - **`$location` `string`** — The URL of the SOAP server to send the request to. — Required if the `$wsdl` parameter is not provided. If both a `$wsdl` parameter and `location` option are provided, the `location` option will over-ride any location specified in the WSDL file. - **`$uri` `string`** — The target namespace of the SOAP service. — Required if the `$wsdl` parameter is not provided; ignored otherwise. - **`$style` `int`** — Specifies the binding style to use for this client, using the constants `SOAP_RPC` and `SOAP_DOCUMENT`. `SOAP_RPC` indicates RPC-style binding, where the SOAP request body contains a standard encoding of a function call. `SOAP_DOCUMENT` indicates document-style binding, where the SOAP request body contains an XML document with service-defined meaning. — If the `$wsdl` parameter is provided, this option is ignored, and the style is read from the WSDL file. — If neither this option nor the `$wsdl` parameter is provided, RPC-style is used. - **`$use` `int`** — Specifies the encoding style to use for this client, using the constants `SOAP_ENCODED` or `SOAP_LITERAL`. `SOAP_ENCODED` indicates encoding using the types defined in the SOAP specification. `SOAP_LITERAL` indicates encoding using a schema defined by the service. — If the `$wsdl` parameter is provided, this option is ignored, and the encoding is read from the WSDL file. — If neither this option nor the `$wsdl` parameter is provided, the "encoded" style is used. - **`$soap_version` `int`** — Specifies the version of the SOAP protocol to use: `SOAP_1_1` for SOAP 1.1, or `SOAP_1_2` for SOAP 1.2. — If omitted, SOAP 1.1 is used. - **`$authentication` `int`** — Specifies the authentication method when using HTTP authentication in requests. The value may be either `SOAP_AUTHENTICATION_BASIC` or `SOAP_AUTHENTICATION_DIGEST`. — If omitted, and the `login` option is provided, Basic Authentication is used. - **`$login` `string`** — Username to use with HTTP Basic or Digest Authentication. - **`$password` `string`** — Password to use with HTTP Basic or Digest Authentication. — Not to be confused with `passphrase`, which is used with HTTPS Client Certificate authentication. - **`$local_cert` `string`** — Path to a client certificate for use with HTTPS authentication. It must be a PEM encoded file which contains the certificate and private key. — The file can also include a chain of issuers, which must come after the client certificate. — Can also be set via `$stream_context`, which also supports specifying a separate private key file. - **`$passphrase` `string`** — Passphrase for the client certificate specified in the `local_cert` option. — Not to be confused with `password`, which is used for Basic or Digest Authentication. — Can also be set via `$stream_context`. - **`$proxy_host` `string`** — Hostname to use as a proxy server for HTTP requests. — The `proxy_port` option must also be specified. - **`$proxy_port` `int`** — TCP port to use when connecting to the proxy server specified in `proxy_host`. - **`$proxy_login` `string`** — Optional username to authenticate with the proxy server specified in `proxy_host`, using HTTP Basic Authentication. - **`$proxy_password` `string`** — Optional password to authenticate with the proxy server specified in `proxy_host`, using HTTP Basic Authentication. - **`$compression` `int`** — Enables compression of HTTP SOAP requests and responses. — The value should be the bitwise OR of three parts: an optional `SOAP_COMPRESSION_ACCEPT`, to send an "Accept-Encoding" header; either `SOAP_COMPRESSION_GZIP` or `SOAP_COMPRESSION_DEFLATE` to indicate the compression algorithm to use; and a number between 1 and 9 to indicate the level of compression to use in the request. For example, to enable two-way gzip compression with the maximum compression level, use `SOAP_COMPRESSION_ACCEPT | SOAP_COMPRESSION_GZIP | 9`. - **`$encoding` `string`** — Defines the internal character encoding. Requests are always sent in UTF-8, and converted to and from this encoding. - **`$trace` `bool`** — Captures request and response information, which can then be accessed with the methods `SoapClient::__getLastRequest()`, `SoapClient::__getLastRequestHeaders()`, `SoapClient::__getLastResponse()`, and `SoapClient::__getLastResponseHeaders()`. — If omitted, defaults to `false` - **`$classmap` `array`** — Used to map types defined in the WSDL to PHP classes. It should be specified as an associative `array` with type names from the WSDL as keys and names of PHP classes as values. Note that the type name of an element is not necessarily the same as the element (tag) name. — The provided class names should always be fully qualified with any namespaces, and never start with a leading `\`. The correct form can be generated by using ::class. — Note that when creating a class, the constructor will not be called, but magic __set() and __get() methods for individual properties will be. — As of PHP 8.4.0, keys may also be specified using Clark notation, in the form `{namespace}type`, to map a type from a specific XML namespace, for example `'{http://example.com}foo'`. This is useful when the same type name is defined in more than one namespace. - **`$typemap` `array`** — Used to define type mappings using user-defined callback functions. Each type mapping should be an array with keys `type_name` (`string` specifying the XML element type); `type_ns` (`string` containing namespace URI); `from_xml` (`callable` accepting one string parameter and returning an object) and `to_xml` (`callable` accepting one object parameter and returning a string). - **`$exceptions` `bool`** — Defines whether errors throw exceptions of type `SoapFault`. — Defaults to `true` - **`$connection_timeout` `int`** — Defines a timeout in seconds for the connection to the SOAP service. This option does not define a timeout for services with slow responses. To limit the time to wait for calls to finish the default_socket_timeout configuration option is available. - **`$cache_wsdl` `int`** — If the `$wsdl` parameter is provided, and the soap.wsdl_cache_enabled configuration option is on, this option determines the type of caching. One of `WSDL_CACHE_NONE`, `WSDL_CACHE_DISK`, `WSDL_CACHE_MEMORY` or `WSDL_CACHE_BOTH`. — Two types of cache are available: in-memory caching, which caches the WSDL in the memory of the current process; and disk caching, which caches the WSDL in a file on disk, shared between all processes. The directory to use for the disk cache is determined by the soap.wsdl_cache_dir configuration option. Both caches use the same lifetime, determined by the soap.wsdl_cache_ttl configuration option. The in-memory cache also has a maximum number of entries determined by the soap.wsdl_cache_limit configuration option. — If not specified, the soap.wsdl_cache configuration option will be used. - **`$user_agent` `string`** — The value to use in the `User-Agent` HTTP header when making requests. — Can also be set via `$stream_context`. — If not specified, the user agent will be `"PHP-SOAP/"` followed by the value of `PHP_VERSION`. - **`$stream_context` `resource`** — A stream context created by `stream_context_create()`, which allows additional options to be set. — The context may include socket context options, SSL context options, plus selected HTTP context options: `content_type`, `header`, `max_redirects`, `protocol_version`, and `user_agent`. — Note that the following HTTP headers are generated automatically or from other options, and will be ignored if specified in the `'header'` context option: `host`, `connection`, `user-agent`, `content-length`, `content-type`, `cookie`, `authorization`, and `proxy-authorization` - **`$features` `int`** — A bitmask to enable one or more of the following features: - **`SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS`** — When decoding a response to an array, the default behaviour is to detect whether an element name appears once or multiple times in a particular parent element. For elements which appear only once, an object property allows direct access to the content; for elements which appear more than once, the property contains an array with the content of each matching element. — If the `SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS` feature is enabled, elements which appear only once are placed in a single-element array, so that access is consistent for all elements. This only has an effect when using a WSDL containing a schema for the response. See Examples section for an illustration. - **`SOAP_USE_XSI_ARRAY_TYPE`** — When the `use` option or WSDL property is set to `encoded`, force arrays to use a type of `SOAP-ENC:Array`, rather than a schema-specific type. - **`SOAP_WAIT_ONE_WAY_CALLS`** — Wait for a response even if the WSDL indicates a one-way request. - **`$keep_alive` `bool`** — a boolean value defining whether to send the `Connection: Keep-Alive` header or `Connection: close`. — Defaults to `true` - **`$ssl_method` `string`** — Specifies the SSL or TLS protocol version to use with secure HTTP connections, instead of the default negotiation. Specifying `SOAP_SSL_METHOD_SSLv2` or `SOAP_SSL_METHOD_SSLv3` will force use of SSL 2 or SSL 3, respectively. Specifying `SOAP_SSL_METHOD_SSLv23` has no effect; the constant exists only for backwards compatibility. As of PHP 7.2.0, specifying `SOAP_SSL_METHOD_TLS` also has no effect; in earlier versions, it forced use of TLS 1.0. — Note that SSL versions 2 and 3 are considered insecure, and may not be supported by the installed OpenSSL library. — This option is *deprecated* as of PHP 8.1.0. A more flexible alternative, which allows specifying individual versions of TLS, is to use the `$stream_context` option with the 'crypto_method' context parameter. ```php <?php // Specifying use of TLS 1.3 only $context = stream_context_create([ 'ssl' => [ 'crypto_method' => STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_3_CLIENT ] ]); $client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", ['context' => $context]); ```

## Errors/Exceptions

`SoapClient::__construct()` will generate an `E_ERROR` error if the `location` and `uri` options aren't provided in non-WSDL mode.

A `SoapFault` exception will be thrown if the `$wsdl` URI cannot be loaded.

## Examples

**`SoapClient::__construct()` example**

```php


<?php

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl");

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", array('soap_version'   => SOAP_1_2));

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", array('login'          => "some_name",
                                            'password'       => "some_password"));

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", array('proxy_host'     => "localhost",
                                            'proxy_port'     => 8080));

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", array('proxy_host'     => "localhost",
                                            'proxy_port'     => 8080,
                                            'proxy_login'    => "some_name",
                                            'proxy_password' => "some_password"));

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", array('local_cert'     => "cert_key.pem"));

$client = new SoapClient(null, array('location' => "http://localhost/soap.php",
                                     'uri'      => "http://test-uri/"));

$client = new SoapClient(null, array('location' => "http://localhost/soap.php",
                                     'uri'      => "http://test-uri/",
                                     'style'    => SOAP_DOCUMENT,
                                     'use'      => SOAP_LITERAL));

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl",
  array('compression' => SOAP_COMPRESSION_ACCEPT | SOAP_COMPRESSION_GZIP | 9));

$client = new SoapClient("some.wsdl", array('encoding'=>'ISO-8859-1'));

class MyBook {
    public $title;
    public $author;
}

$client = new SoapClient("books.wsdl", array('classmap' => array('book' => "MyBook")));

$typemap = array(
    array("type_ns"  => "http://schemas.example.com",
         "type_name" => "book",
         "from_xml"  => "unserialize_book",
         "to_xml"    => "serialize_book")
);
$client = new SoapClient("books.wsdl", array('typemap' => $typemap));

?>

    
```

**Using the `SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS` feature**

```php


<?php
/* Assuming a response like this, and an appropriate WSDL:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns="urn:example">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <response>
            <collection>
                <item>Single</item>
            </collection>
            <collection>
                <item>First</item>
                <item>Second</item>
            </collection>
        </response>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
*/

echo "Default:\n";

$client = new TestSoapClient(__DIR__ . '/temp.wsdl');
$response = $client->exampleRequest();
var_dump( $response->collection[0]->item );
var_dump( $response->collection[1]->item );

echo "\nWith SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS:\n";

$client = new TestSoapClient(__DIR__ . '/temp.wsdl', ['features' => SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS]);
$response = $client->exampleRequest();
var_dump( $response->collection[0]->item );
var_dump( $response->collection[1]->item );

    
```

The above example will output:

```text


Default:
string(6) "Single"
array(2) {
  [0] =>
  string(5) "First"
  [1] =>
  string(6) "Second"
}

With SOAP_SINGLE_ELEMENT_ARRAYS:
array(1) {
  [0] =>
  string(6) "Single"
}
array(2) {
  [0] =>
  string(5) "First"
  [1] =>
  string(6) "Second"
}

    
```
