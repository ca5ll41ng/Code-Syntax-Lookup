# Calculate a unique identifier for the contained objects

## Description

```php
public string SplObjectStorage::getHash(object $object)
```

This method calculates an identifier for the objects added to an `SplObjectStorage` object.

The implementation in `SplObjectStorage` returns the same value as `spl_object_hash()`.

The storage object will never contain more than one object with the same identifier. As such, it can be used to implement a set (a collection of unique values) where the quality of an object being unique is determined by the value returned by this function being unique.

## Parameters

- **`$object`** — The object whose identifier is to be calculated.

## Return Values

A `string` with the calculated identifier.

## Errors/Exceptions

A `RuntimeException` is thrown when the returned value is not a `string`.

## Examples

**`SplObjectStorage::getHash()` example**

```php


<?php
class OneSpecimenPerClassStorage extends SplObjectStorage {
    public function getHash($o) {
        return get_class($o);
    }
}
class A {}

$s = new OneSpecimenPerClassStorage;
$o1 = new stdClass;
$o2 = new stdClass;
$o3 = new A;

$s[$o1] = 1;
//$o2 is considered equal to $o1 so the value is replaced
$s[$o2] = 2;
$s[$o3] = 3;

//these are considered equal to the objects before
//so they can be used to access the values stored under them
$p1 = new stdClass;
$p2 = new A;
echo $s[$p1], "\n";
echo $s[$p2], "\n";
?>

    
```

The above example will output something similar to:

```text


2
3

    
```
