# Efficiently move the engine ahead by 2^128 steps

## Description

```php
public void Random\Engine\Xoshiro256StarStar::jump()
```

Moves the algorithm’s state ahead by 2128 steps, as if `Random\Engine\Xoshiro256StarStar::generate()` was called 2128 times.

The purpose of a jump is to facilitate the creation of a new `Random\Engine\Xoshiro256StarStar` engine from an existing seeded `Random\Engine\Xoshiro256StarStar` engine. The seeded engine acts as a blueprint, which can be cloned and repeatedly jumped to create 2128 non-overlapping sequences with 2128 values each.

## Parameters

This function has no parameters.

## Return Values

No value is returned.

## Examples

**`Random\Engine\Xoshiro256StarStar::jump()` example**

```php


<?php
use Random\Engine\Xoshiro256StarStar;
use Random\Randomizer;

$blueprintRng = new Xoshiro256StarStar(0);

$fibers = [];
for ($i = 0; $i < 8; $i++) {
    $fiberRng = clone $blueprintRng;
    $blueprintRng->jump();

    $fiber = new Fiber(static function () use ($fiberRng, $i): void {
        $randomizer = new Randomizer($fiberRng);

        while (true) {
            Fiber::suspend();

            echo "{$i}: ", $randomizer->getInt(0, 100), "\n";
        }
    });
    $fiber->start();

    $fibers[] = $fiber;
}

// Even though the fibers execute in a random order, they will print the same value
// each time, because each has its own unique instance of the RNG.
$randomizer = new Randomizer();

$fibers = $randomizer->shuffleArray($fibers);
foreach ($fibers as $fiber) {
    $fiber->resume();
}

$fibers = $randomizer->shuffleArray($fibers);
foreach ($fibers as $fiber) {
    $fiber->resume();
}
?>

   
```

The above example will output something similar to:

```text


4: 89
3: 10
2: 63
1: 75
6: 41
5: 56
0: 16
7: 60
7: 34
6: 58
1: 74
4: 63
3: 3
5: 42
2: 45
0: 86

   
```
