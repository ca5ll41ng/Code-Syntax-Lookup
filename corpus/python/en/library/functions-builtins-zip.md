# zip

Iterate over several iterables in parallel, producing tuples with an item
from each one.

Example::

   >>> for item in zip([1, 2, 3], ['sugar', 'spice', 'everything nice']):
   ...     print(item)
   ...
   (1, 'sugar')
   (2, 'spice')
   (3, 'everything nice')

More formally: `zip` returns an iterator of tuples, where the *i*-th
tuple contains the *i*-th element from each of the argument iterables.

Another way to think of `zip` is that it turns rows into columns, and
columns into rows.  This is similar to `transposing a matrix
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose>`_.

`zip` is lazy: The elements won't be processed until the iterable is
iterated on, e.g. by a `for` loop or by wrapping in a
`list`.

One thing to consider is that the iterables passed to `zip` could have
different lengths; sometimes by design, and sometimes because of a bug in
the code that prepared these iterables.  Python offers three different
approaches to dealing with this issue:

* By default, `zip` stops when the shortest iterable is `exhausted`.
  It will ignore the remaining items in the longer iterables, cutting off
  the result to the length of the shortest iterable::

     >>> list(zip(range(3), ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum']))
     [(0, 'fee'), (1, 'fi'), (2, 'fo')]

* `zip` is often used in cases where the iterables are assumed to be
  of equal length.  In such cases, it's recommended to use the `strict=True`
  option. Its output is the same as regular `zip`::

     >>> list(zip(('a', 'b', 'c'), (1, 2, 3), strict=True))
     [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]

  Unlike the default behavior, it raises a `ValueError` if one iterable
  is `exhausted` before the others:

     >>> for item in zip(range(3), ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'], strict=True):  # doctest: +SKIP
     ...     print(item)
     ...
     (0, 'fee')
     (1, 'fi')
     (2, 'fo')
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
     ValueError: zip() argument 2 is longer than argument 1

  ..
     This doctest is disabled because doctest does not support capturing
     output and exceptions in the same code unit.

  Without the `strict=True` argument, any bug that results in iterables of
  different lengths will be silenced, possibly manifesting as a hard-to-find
  bug in another part of the program.

* Shorter iterables can be padded with a constant value to make all the
  iterables have the same length.  This is done by
  `itertools.zip_longest`.

Edge cases: With a single iterable argument, `zip` returns an
iterator of 1-tuples.  With no arguments, it returns an empty iterator.

Tips and tricks:

* The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This
  makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups
  using `zip(*[iter(s)]*n, strict=True)`.  This repeats the *same* iterator
  `n` times so that each output tuple has the result of `n` calls to the
  iterator. This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks.

* `zip` in conjunction with the `*` operator can be used to unzip a
  list::

     >>> x = [1, 2, 3]
     >>> y = [4, 5, 6]
     >>> list(zip(x, y))
     [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
     >>> x2, y2 = zip(*zip(x, y))
     >>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
     True

> *Changed in 3.10*: Added the ``strict`` argument.
