# Issue with file descriptors

.. _faulthandler-fd:

**Issue with file descriptors**

`enable`, `dump_traceback_later` and `register` keep the
file descriptor of their *file* argument. If the file is closed and its file
descriptor is reused by a new file, or if `os.dup2` is used to replace
the file descriptor, the traceback will be written into a different file. Call
these functions again each time that the file is replaced.

**Example**

Example of a segmentation fault on Linux with and without enabling the fault
handler:

```shell-session

$ python -c "import ctypes; ctypes.string_at(0)"
Segmentation fault

$ python -q -X faulthandler
>>> import ctypes
>>> ctypes.string_at(0)
Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault
