# sentinel

Return a new unique sentinel object.  *name* must be a `str`, and is
used by default as the returned object's representation::

   >>> MISSING = sentinel("MISSING")
   >>> MISSING
   MISSING

The optional *repr* argument can be used to specify a different representation::

   >>> MISSING = sentinel("MISSING", repr="<MISSING>")
   >>> MISSING
   <MISSING>

Sentinel objects are truthy and compare equal only to themselves.  They are
intended to be compared with the `is` operator.

`sentinel` does not support subclassing.

Shallow and deep copies of a sentinel object return the object itself.

Sentinels are conventionally assigned to a variable with a matching name.
Sentinels defined in this way can be used in `type hints`::

   MISSING = sentinel("MISSING")

   def next_value(default: int | MISSING = MISSING):
       ...

Sentinel objects support the `|` operator for use in type expressions.

`Pickling` is supported for sentinel objects that are
placed in the global scope of a module under a name matching the sentinel's
name, and for sentinels placed in class scopes with a name matching the
`qualified name` of the sentinel. Other sentinels, such as those
defined in a function scope, are not picklable. The identity of the sentinel is preserved
after pickling::

   import pickle

   PICKLABLE = sentinel("PICKLABLE")

   assert pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(PICKLABLE)) is PICKLABLE

   class Cls:
       PICKLABLE = sentinel("Cls.PICKLABLE")

   assert pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(Cls.PICKLABLE)) is Cls.PICKLABLE

Sentinel objects have the following attributes:

attribute:: __name__

attribute:: __module__
