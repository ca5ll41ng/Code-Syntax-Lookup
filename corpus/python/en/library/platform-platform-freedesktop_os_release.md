# freedesktop_os_release

Get operating system identification from `os-release` file and return
it as a dict. The `os-release` file is a `freedesktop.org standard
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html>`_ and
is available in most Linux distributions. A noticeable exception is
Android and Android-based distributions.

Raises `OSError` or subclass when neither `/etc/os-release` nor
`/usr/lib/os-release` can be read.

On success, the function returns a dictionary where keys and values are
strings. Values have their special characters like `"` and `$`
unquoted. The fields `NAME`, `ID`, and `PRETTY_NAME` are always
defined according to the standard. All other fields are optional. Vendors
may include additional fields.

Note that fields like `NAME`, `VERSION`, and `VARIANT` are strings
suitable for presentation to users. Programs should use fields like
`ID`, `ID_LIKE`, `VERSION_ID`, or `VARIANT_ID` to identify
Linux distributions.

Example::

   def get_like_distro():
       info = platform.freedesktop_os_release()
       ids = [info["ID"]]
       if "ID_LIKE" in info:
           # ids are space separated and ordered by precedence
           ids.extend(info["ID_LIKE"].split())
       return ids
