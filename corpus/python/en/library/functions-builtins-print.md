# print

Print *objects* to the text stream *file*, separated by *sep* and followed
by *end*.  *sep*, *end*, *file*, and *flush*, if present, must be given as keyword
arguments.

All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like `str` does and
written to the stream, separated by *sep* and followed by *end*.  Both *sep*
and *end* must be strings; they can also be `None`, which means to use the
default values.  If no *objects* are given, `print` will just write
*end*.

The *file* argument must be an object with a `write(string)` method; if it
is not present or `None`, `sys.stdout` will be used.  Since printed
arguments are converted to text strings, `print` cannot be used with
binary mode file objects.  For these, use `file.write(...)` instead.

Output buffering is usually determined by *file*.
However, if *flush* is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.

> *Changed in 3.3*: Added the *flush* keyword argument.
