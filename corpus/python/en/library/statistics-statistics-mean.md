# mean

Return the sample arithmetic mean of *data* which can be a sequence or iterable.

The arithmetic mean is the sum of the data divided by the number of data
points.  It is commonly called "the average", although it is only one of many
different mathematical averages.  It is a measure of the central location of
the data.

If *data* is empty, `StatisticsError` will be raised.

Some examples of use:

```python

>>> mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])
2.8
>>> mean([-1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 5.75])
2.625

>>> from fractions import Fraction as F
>>> mean([F(3, 7), F(1, 21), F(5, 3), F(1, 3)])
Fraction(13, 21)

>>> from decimal import Decimal as D
>>> mean([D("0.5"), D("0.75"), D("0.625"), D("0.375")])
Decimal('0.5625')
```

> **Note**

> The mean is strongly affected by `outliers
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier>`_ and is not necessarily a
> typical example of the data points. For a more robust, although less
> efficient, measure of `central tendency
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency>`_, see `median`.

> The sample mean gives an unbiased estimate of the true population mean,
> so that when taken on average over all the possible samples,
> `mean(sample)` converges on the true mean of the entire population.  If
> *data* represents the entire population rather than a sample, then
> `mean(data)` is equivalent to calculating the true population mean μ.
