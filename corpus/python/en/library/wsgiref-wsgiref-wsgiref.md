# Examples

**Examples**

This is a working "Hello World" WSGI application, where the *start_response*
callable should follow the `.StartResponse` protocol::

   """
   Every WSGI application must have an application object - a callable
   object that accepts two arguments. For that purpose, we're going to
   use a function (note that you're not limited to a function, you can
   use a class for example). The first argument passed to the function
   is a dictionary containing CGI-style environment variables and the
   second variable is the callable object.
   """
   from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

   def hello_world_app(environ, start_response):
       status = "200 OK"  # HTTP Status
       headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8")]  # HTTP Headers
       start_response(status, headers)

       # The returned object is going to be printed
       return [b"Hello World"]

   with make_server("", 8000, hello_world_app) as httpd:
       print("Serving on port 8000...")

       # Serve until process is killed

    optional port number (defaults to 8000), then tries to serve files.
