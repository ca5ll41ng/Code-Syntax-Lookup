# compress

Compresses the bytes in *data*, returning a bytes object containing compressed data.
*level* is an integer from `0` to `9` or `-1` controlling the level of compression;
See `Z_BEST_SPEED` (`1`), `Z_BEST_COMPRESSION` (`9`),
`Z_NO_COMPRESSION` (`0`), and the default,
`Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION` (`-1`) for more information about these values.

.. _compress-wbits:

The *wbits* argument controls the size of the history buffer (or the
"window size") used when compressing data, and whether a header and
trailer is included in the output.  It can take several ranges of values,
defaulting to `15` (`MAX_WBITS`):

* +9 to +15: The base-two logarithm of the window size, which
  therefore ranges between 512 and 32768.  Larger values produce
  better compression at the expense of greater memory usage.  The
  resulting output will include a zlib-specific header and trailer.

* −9 to −15: Uses the absolute value of *wbits* as the
  window size logarithm, while producing a raw output stream with no
  header or trailing checksum.

* +25 to +31 = 16 + (9 to 15): Uses the low 4 bits of the value as the
  window size logarithm, while including a basic `gzip` header
  and trailing checksum in the output.

Raises the `error` exception if any error occurs.

> *Changed in 3.6*: *level* can now be used as a keyword parameter.

> *Changed in 3.11*: The *wbits* parameter is now available to set window bits and compression type.
