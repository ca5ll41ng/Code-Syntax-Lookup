# median

Return the median (middle value) of numeric data, using the common "mean of
middle two" method.  If *data* is empty, `StatisticsError` is raised.
*data* can be a sequence or iterable.

The median is a robust measure of central location and is less affected by
the presence of outliers.  When the number of data points is odd, the
middle data point is returned:

```python

>>> median([1, 3, 5])
3
```

When the number of data points is even, the median is interpolated by taking
the average of the two middle values:

```python

>>> median([1, 3, 5, 7])
4.0
```

This is suited for when your data is discrete, and you don't mind that the
median may not be an actual data point.

If the data is ordinal (supports order operations) but not numeric (doesn't
support addition), consider using `median_low` or `median_high`
instead.
