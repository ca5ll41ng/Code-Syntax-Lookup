# set_wakeup_fd

Set the wakeup file descriptor to *fd*.  When a signal your program has
registered a signal handler for is received, the signal number is written as
a single byte into the fd.  If you haven't registered a signal handler for
the signals you care about, then nothing will be written to the wakeup fd.
This can be used by a library to wakeup a poll or select call, allowing the
signal to be fully processed.

The old wakeup fd is returned (or -1 if file descriptor wakeup was not
enabled).  If *fd* is -1, file descriptor wakeup is disabled.
If not -1, *fd* must be non-blocking.  It is up to the library to remove
any bytes from *fd* before calling poll or select again.

When threads are enabled, this function can only be called
from `the main thread of the main interpreter`;
attempting to call it from other threads will cause a `ValueError`
exception to be raised.

There are two common ways to use this function. In both approaches,
you use the fd to wake up when a signal arrives, but then they
differ in how they determine *which* signal or signals have
arrived.

In the first approach, we read the data out of the fd's buffer, and
the byte values give you the signal numbers. This is simple, but in
rare cases it can run into a problem: generally the fd will have a
limited amount of buffer space, and if too many signals arrive too
quickly, then the buffer may become full, and some signals may be
lost. If you use this approach, then you should set
`warn_on_full_buffer=True`, which will at least cause a warning
to be printed to stderr when signals are lost.

In the second approach, we use the wakeup fd *only* for wakeups,
and ignore the actual byte values. In this case, all we care about
is whether the fd's buffer is empty or non-empty; a full buffer
doesn't indicate a problem at all. If you use this approach, then
you should set `warn_on_full_buffer=False`, so that your users
are not confused by spurious warning messages.

> *Changed in 3.5*: On Windows, the function now also supports socket handles.

> *Changed in 3.7*: Added ``warn_on_full_buffer`` parameter.
