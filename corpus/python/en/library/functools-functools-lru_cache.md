# lru_cache

Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the
*maxsize* most recent calls.  It can save time when an expensive or I/O bound
function is periodically called with the same arguments.

The cache is threadsafe so that the wrapped function can be used in
multiple threads.  This means that the underlying data structure will
remain coherent during concurrent updates.

It is possible for the wrapped function to be called more than once if
another thread makes an additional call before the initial call has been
completed and cached.

Since a dictionary is used to cache results, the positional and keyword
arguments to the function must be `hashable`.

Distinct argument patterns may be considered to be distinct calls with
separate cache entries.  For example, `f(a=1, b=2)` and `f(b=2, a=1)`
differ in their keyword argument order and may have two separate cache
entries.

If *user_function* is specified, it must be a callable. This allows the
*lru_cache* decorator to be applied directly to a user function, leaving
the *maxsize* at its default value of 128::

    @lru_cache
    def count_vowels(word):
        return sum(word.count(vowel) for vowel in 'AEIOUaeiou')

If *maxsize* is set to `None`, the LRU feature is disabled and the cache can
grow without bound.

If *typed* is set to true, function arguments of different types will be
cached separately.  If *typed* is false, the implementation will usually
regard them as equivalent calls and only cache a single result. (Some
types such as *str* and *int* may be cached separately even when *typed*
is false.)

Note, type specificity applies only to the function's immediate arguments
rather than their contents.  The scalar arguments, `Decimal(42)` and
`Fraction(42)` are treated as distinct calls with distinct results.
In contrast, the tuple arguments `('answer', Decimal(42))` and
`('answer', Fraction(42))` are treated as equivalent.

The wrapped function is instrumented with a `cache_parameters`
function that returns a new `dict` showing the values for *maxsize*
and *typed*.  This is for information purposes only.  Mutating the values
has no effect.

method:: lru_cache.cache_info()

To help measure the effectiveness of the cache and tune the *maxsize*
parameter, the wrapped function is instrumented with a `cache_info`
function that returns a `named tuple` showing *hits*, *misses*,
*maxsize* and *currsize*.

method:: lru_cache.cache_clear()

The decorator also provides a `cache_clear` function for clearing or
invalidating the cache.

The original underlying function is accessible through the
`__wrapped__` attribute.  This is useful for introspection, for
bypassing the cache, or for rewrapping the function with a different cache.

The cache keeps references to the arguments and return values until they age
out of the cache or until the cache is cleared.

If a method is cached, the `self` instance argument is included in the
cache.  See `faq-cache-method-calls`

An `LRU (least recently used) cache
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_Recently_Used_(LRU)>`_
works best when the most recent calls are the best predictors of upcoming
calls (for example, the most popular articles on a news server tend to
change each day).  The cache's size limit assures that the cache does not
grow without bound on long-running processes such as web servers.

In general, the LRU cache should only be used when you want to reuse
previously computed values.  Accordingly, it doesn't make sense to cache
functions with side-effects, functions that need to create
distinct mutable objects on each call (such as generators and async functions),
or impure functions such as time() or random().

Example of an LRU cache for static web content::

     @lru_cache(maxsize=32)
     def get_pep(num):
         'Retrieve text of a Python Enhancement Proposal'
         resource = f'https://peps.python.org/pep-{num:04d}'
         try:
             with urllib.request.urlopen(resource) as s:
                 return s.read()
         except urllib.error.HTTPError:
             return 'Not Found'

     >>> for n in 8, 290, 308, 320, 8, 218, 320, 279, 289, 320, 9991:
     ...     pep = get_pep(n)
     ...     print(n, len(pep))

     >>> get_pep.cache_info()
     CacheInfo(hits=3, misses=8, maxsize=32, currsize=8)

Example of efficiently computing
[Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
using a cache to implement a
[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
technique::

     @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
     def fib(n):
         if n < 2:
             return n
         return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

     >>> [fib(n) for n in range(16)]
     [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610]

     >>> fib.cache_info()
     CacheInfo(hits=28, misses=16, maxsize=None, currsize=16)

> *Added in 3.2*

> *Changed in 3.3*: Added the *typed* option.

> *Changed in 3.8*: Added the *user_function* option.

> *Changed in 3.9*: Added the function :func:`!cache_parameters`
