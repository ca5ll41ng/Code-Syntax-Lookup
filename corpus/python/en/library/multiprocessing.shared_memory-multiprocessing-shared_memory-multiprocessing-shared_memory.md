# The following example demonstrates basic use of a `ShareableList`

The following example demonstrates basic use of a `ShareableList`
instance:

   >>> from multiprocessing import shared_memory
   >>> a = shared_memory.ShareableList(['howdy', b'HoWdY', -273.154, 100, None, True, 42])
   >>> [ type(entry) for entry in a ]
   [<class 'str'>, <class 'bytes'>, <class 'float'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'NoneType'>, <class 'bool'>, <class 'int'>]
   >>> a[2]
   -273.154
   >>> a[2] = -78.5
   >>> a[2]
   -78.5
   >>> a[2] = 'dry ice'  # Changing data types is supported as well
   >>> a[2]
   'dry ice'
   >>> a[2] = 'larger than previously allocated storage space'
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
   ValueError: exceeds available storage for existing str
   >>> a[2]
   'dry ice'
   >>> len(a)
   7
   >>> a.index(42)
   6
   >>> a.count(b'howdy')
   0
   >>> a.count(b'HoWdY')
   1
   >>> a.shm.close()
   >>> a.shm.unlink()
   >>> del a  # Use of a ShareableList after call to unlink() is unsupported

The following example depicts how one, two, or many processes may access the
same `ShareableList` by supplying the name of the shared memory block
behind it:

   >>> b = shared_memory.ShareableList(range(5))         # In a first process
   >>> c = shared_memory.ShareableList(name=b.shm.name)  # In a second process
   >>> c
   ShareableList([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], name='...')
   >>> c[-1] = -999
   >>> b[-1]
   -999
   >>> b.shm.close()
   >>> c.shm.close()
   >>> c.shm.unlink()

The following examples demonstrates that `ShareableList`
(and underlying `SharedMemory`) objects
can be pickled and unpickled if needed.
Note, that it will still be the same shared object.
This happens, because the deserialized object has
the same unique name and is just attached to an existing
object with the same name (if the object is still alive):

   >>> import pickle
   >>> from multiprocessing import shared_memory
   >>> sl = shared_memory.ShareableList(range(10))
   >>> list(sl)
   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

   >>> deserialized_sl = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(sl))
   >>> list(deserialized_sl)
   [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

   >>> sl[0] = -1
   >>> deserialized_sl[1] = -2
   >>> list(sl)
   [-1, -2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
   >>> list(deserialized_sl)
   [-1, -2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

   >>> sl.shm.close()
   >>> sl.shm.unlink()
