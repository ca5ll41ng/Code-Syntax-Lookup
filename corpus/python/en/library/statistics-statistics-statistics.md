# Examples and Recipes

**Examples and Recipes**

Classic probability problems
****************************

`NormalDist` readily solves classic probability problems.

For example, given `historical data for SAT exams
<https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_226.40.asp>`_ showing
that scores are normally distributed with a mean of 1060 and a standard
deviation of 195, determine the percentage of students with test scores
between 1100 and 1200, after rounding to the nearest whole number:

```python

>>> sat = NormalDist(1060, 195)
>>> fraction = sat.cdf(1200 + 0.5) - sat.cdf(1100 - 0.5)
>>> round(fraction * 100.0, 1)
18.4
```

Find the [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) and `deciles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decile>`_ for the SAT scores:

```python

>>> list(map(round, sat.quantiles()))
[928, 1060, 1192]
>>> list(map(round, sat.quantiles(n=10)))
[810, 896, 958, 1011, 1060, 1109, 1162, 1224, 1310]
```

Monte Carlo inputs for simulations
**********************************

To estimate the distribution for a model that isn't easy to solve
analytically, `NormalDist` can generate input samples for a `Monte
Carlo simulation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method>`_:

```python

>>> def model(x, y, z):
...     return (3*x + 7*x*y - 5*y) / (11 * z)
...
>>> n = 100_000
>>> X = NormalDist(10, 2.5).samples(n, seed=3652260728)
>>> Y = NormalDist(15, 1.75).samples(n, seed=4582495471)
>>> Z = NormalDist(50, 1.25).samples(n, seed=6582483453)
>>> quantiles(map(model, X, Y, Z))       # doctest: +SKIP
[1.4591308524824727, 1.8035946855390597, 2.175091447274739]
```

Approximating binomial distributions
************************************

Normal distributions can be used to approximate `Binomial
distributions <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialDistribution.html>`_
when the sample size is large and when the probability of a successful
trial is near 50%.

For example, an open source conference has 750 attendees and two rooms with a
500 person capacity.  There is a talk about Python and another about Ruby.
In previous conferences, 65% of the attendees preferred to listen to Python
talks.  Assuming the population preferences haven't changed, what is the
probability that the Python room will stay within its capacity limits?

```python

>>> n = 750             # Sample size
>>> p = 0.65            # Preference for Python
>>> q = 1.0 - p         # Preference for Ruby
>>> k = 500             # Room capacity

>>> # Approximation using the cumulative normal distribution
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> round(NormalDist(mu=n*p, sigma=sqrt(n*p*q)).cdf(k + 0.5), 4)
0.8402

>>> # Exact solution using the cumulative binomial distribution
>>> from math import comb, fsum
>>> round(fsum(comb(n, r) * p**r * q**(n-r) for r in range(k+1)), 4)
0.8402

>>> # Approximation using a simulation
>>> from random import seed, binomialvariate
>>> seed(8675309)
>>> mean(binomialvariate(n, p) <= k for i in range(10_000))
0.8406
```

Naive bayesian classifier
*************************

Normal distributions commonly arise in machine learning problems.

Wikipedia has a `nice example of a Naive Bayesian Classifier
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Person_classification>`_.
The challenge is to predict a person's gender from measurements of normally
distributed features including height, weight, and foot size.

We're given a training dataset with measurements for eight people.  The
measurements are assumed to be normally distributed, so we summarize the data
with `NormalDist`:

```python

>>> height_male = NormalDist.from_samples([6, 5.92, 5.58, 5.92])
>>> height_female = NormalDist.from_samples([5, 5.5, 5.42, 5.75])
>>> weight_male = NormalDist.from_samples([180, 190, 170, 165])
>>> weight_female = NormalDist.from_samples([100, 150, 130, 150])
>>> foot_size_male = NormalDist.from_samples([12, 11, 12, 10])
>>> foot_size_female = NormalDist.from_samples([6, 8, 7, 9])
```

Next, we encounter a new person whose feature measurements are known but whose
gender is unknown:

```python

>>> ht = 6.0        # height
>>> wt = 130        # weight
>>> fs = 8          # foot size
```

Starting with a 50% `prior probability
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability>`_ of being male or female,
we compute the posterior as the prior times the product of likelihoods for the
feature measurements given the gender:

```python

>>> prior_male = 0.5
>>> prior_female = 0.5
>>> posterior_male = (prior_male * height_male.pdf(ht) *
...                   weight_male.pdf(wt) * foot_size_male.pdf(fs))

>>> posterior_female = (prior_female * height_female.pdf(ht) *
...                     weight_female.pdf(wt) * foot_size_female.pdf(fs))
```

The final prediction goes to the largest posterior. This is known as the
`maximum a posteriori
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation>`_ or MAP:

```python

>>> 'male' if posterior_male > posterior_female else 'female'
'female'
```
