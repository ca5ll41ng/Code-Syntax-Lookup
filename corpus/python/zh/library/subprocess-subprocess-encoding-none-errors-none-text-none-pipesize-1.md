Execute a child program in a new process.  On POSIX, the class uses
`os.execvpe`-like behavior to execute the child program.  On Windows,
the class uses the Windows `CreateProcess()` function.  The arguments to
`Popen` are as follows.

*args* should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string
or `path-like object`.
By default, the program to execute is the first item in *args* if *args* is
a sequence.  If *args* is a string, the interpretation is
platform-dependent and described below.  See the *shell* and *executable*
arguments for additional differences from the default behavior.  Unless
otherwise stated, it is recommended to pass *args* as a sequence.

An example of passing some arguments to an external program
as a sequence is::

  Popen(["/usr/bin/git", "commit", "-m", "Fixes a bug."])

On POSIX, if *args* is a string, the string is interpreted as the name or
path of the program to execute.  However, this can only be done if not
passing arguments to the program.

On Windows, if *args* is a sequence, it will be converted to a string in a
manner described in `converting-argument-sequence`.  This is because
the underlying `CreateProcess()` operates on strings.

> *Changed in 3.6*: *args* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object` if *shell* is ``False`` and a sequence containing path-like objects on POSIX.

> *Changed in 3.8*: *args* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object` if *shell* is ``False`` and a sequence containing bytes and path-like objects on Windows.

The *shell* argument (which defaults to `False`) specifies whether to use
the shell as the program to execute.  If *shell* is `True`, it is
recommended to pass *args* as a string rather than as a sequence.

On POSIX with `shell=True`, the shell defaults to `/bin/sh`.  If
*args* is a string, the string specifies the command
to execute through the shell.  This means that the string must be
formatted exactly as it would be when typed at the shell prompt.  This
includes, for example, quoting or backslash escaping filenames with spaces in
them.  If *args* is a sequence, the first item specifies the command string, and
any additional items will be treated as additional arguments to the shell
itself.  That is to say, `Popen` does the equivalent of::

   Popen(['/bin/sh', '-c', args[0], args[1], ...])

On Windows with `shell=True`, the `COMSPEC` environment variable
specifies the default shell.  The only time you need to specify
`shell=True` on Windows is when the command you wish to execute is built
into the shell (e.g. `dir` or `copy`).  You do not need
`shell=True` to run a batch file or console-based executable.

*bufsize* will be supplied as the corresponding argument to the
`open` function when creating the stdin/stdout/stderr pipe
file objects:

- `0` means unbuffered (read and write are one
  system call and can return short)
- `1` means line buffered
  (only usable if `text=True` or `universal_newlines=True`)
- any other positive value means use a buffer of approximately that
  size
- negative bufsize (the default) means the system default of
  io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE will be used.

> *Changed in 3.3.1*: *bufsize* now defaults to -1 to enable buffering by default to match the behavior that most code expects.  In versions prior to Python 3.2.4 and 3.3.1 it incorrectly defaulted to ``0`` which was unbuffered and allowed short reads.  This was unintentional and did not match the behavior of Python 2 as most code expected.

The *executable* argument specifies a replacement program to execute.   It
is very seldom needed.  When `shell=False`, *executable* replaces the
program to execute specified by *args*.  However, the original *args* is
still passed to the program.  Most programs treat the program specified
by *args* as the command name, which can then be different from the program
actually executed.  On POSIX, the *args* name
becomes the display name for the executable in utilities such as
`ps`.  If `shell=True`, on POSIX the *executable* argument
specifies a replacement shell for the default `/bin/sh`.

> *Changed in 3.6*: *executable* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object` on POSIX.

> *Changed in 3.8*: *executable* parameter accepts a bytes and :term:`path-like object` on Windows.

> *Changed in 3.12*: Changed Windows shell search order for ``shell=True``. The current directory and ``%PATH%`` are replaced with ``%COMSPEC%`` and ``%SystemRoot%\System32\cmd.exe``. As a result, dropping a malicious program named ``cmd.exe`` into a current directory no longer works.

*stdin*, *stdout* and *stderr* specify the executed program's standard input,
standard output and standard error file handles, respectively.  Valid values
are `None`, `PIPE`, `DEVNULL`, an existing file descriptor (a
positive integer), and an existing `file object` with a valid file
descriptor.  With the default settings of `None`, no redirection will
occur.  `PIPE` indicates that a new pipe to the child should be
created.  `DEVNULL` indicates that the special file `os.devnull`
will be used.  Additionally, *stderr* can be `STDOUT`, which indicates
that the stderr data from the applications should be captured into the same
file handle as for *stdout*.

If *preexec_fn* is set to a callable object, this object will be called in the
child process just before the child is executed.
(POSIX only)

> **Warning**
>
> The *preexec_fn* parameter is NOT SAFE to use in the presence of threads
> in your application.  The child process could deadlock before exec is
> called.
>

> **Note**
>
> If you need to modify the environment for the child use the *env*
> parameter rather than doing it in a *preexec_fn*.
> The *start_new_session* and *process_group* parameters should take the place of
> code using *preexec_fn* to call `os.setsid` or `os.setpgid` in the child.
>

> *Changed in 3.8*: The *preexec_fn* parameter is no longer supported in subinterpreters. The use of the parameter in a subinterpreter raises :exc:`RuntimeError`. The new restriction may affect applications that are deployed in mod_wsgi, uWSGI, and other embedded environments.

If *close_fds* is true, all file descriptors except `0`, `1` and
`2` will be closed before the child process is executed.  Otherwise
when *close_fds* is false, file descriptors obey their inheritable flag
as described in `fd_inheritance`.

On Windows, if *close_fds* is true then no handles will be inherited by the
child process unless explicitly passed in the `handle_list` element of
`STARTUPINFO.lpAttributeList`, or by standard handle redirection.

> *Changed in 3.2*: The default for *close_fds* was changed from :const:`False` to what is described above.

> *Changed in 3.7*: On Windows the default for *close_fds* was changed from :const:`False` to :const:`True` when redirecting the standard handles. It's now possible to set *close_fds* to :const:`True` when redirecting the standard handles.

*pass_fds* is an optional sequence of file descriptors to keep open
between the parent and child.  Providing any *pass_fds* forces
*close_fds* to be `True`.  (POSIX only)

> *Changed in 3.2*: The *pass_fds* parameter was added.

If *cwd* is not `None`, the function changes the working directory to
*cwd* before executing the child.  *cwd* can be a string, bytes or
`path-like` object.  On POSIX, the function
looks for *executable* (or for the first item in *args*) relative to *cwd*
if the executable path is a relative path.

> *Changed in 3.6*: *cwd* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object` on POSIX.

> *Changed in 3.7*: *cwd* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object` on Windows.

> *Changed in 3.8*: *cwd* parameter accepts a bytes object on Windows.

If *restore_signals* is true (the default) all signals that Python has set to
SIG_IGN are restored to SIG_DFL in the child process before the exec.
Currently this includes the SIGPIPE, SIGXFZ and SIGXFSZ signals.
(POSIX only)

> *Changed in 3.2*: *restore_signals* was added.

If *start_new_session* is true the `setsid()` system call will be made in the
child process prior to the execution of the subprocess.

availability:: POSIX

> *Changed in 3.2*: *start_new_session* was added.

If *process_group* is a non-negative integer, the `setpgid(0, value)` system call will
be made in the child process prior to the execution of the subprocess.

availability:: POSIX

> *Changed in 3.11*: *process_group* was added.

If *group* is not `None`, the setregid() system call will be made in the
child process prior to the execution of the subprocess. If the provided
value is a string, it will be looked up via `grp.getgrnam` and
the value in `gr_gid` will be used. If the value is an integer, it
will be passed verbatim. (POSIX only)

availability:: POSIX

> *Added in 3.9*

If *extra_groups* is not `None`, the setgroups() system call will be
made in the child process prior to the execution of the subprocess.
Strings provided in *extra_groups* will be looked up via
`grp.getgrnam` and the values in `gr_gid` will be used.
Integer values will be passed verbatim. (POSIX only)

availability:: POSIX

> *Added in 3.9*

If *user* is not `None`, the setreuid() system call will be made in the
child process prior to the execution of the subprocess. If the provided
value is a string, it will be looked up via `pwd.getpwnam` and
the value in `pw_uid` will be used. If the value is an integer, it will
be passed verbatim. (POSIX only)

> **Note**
>
> Specifying *user* will not drop existing supplementary group memberships!
> The caller must also pass `extra_groups=()` to reduce the group membership
> of the child process for security purposes.

availability:: POSIX

> *Added in 3.9*

If *umask* is not negative, the umask() system call will be made in the
child process prior to the execution of the subprocess.

availability:: POSIX

> *Added in 3.9*

If *env* is not `None`, it must be a mapping that defines the environment
variables for the new process; these are used instead of the default
behavior of inheriting the current process' environment. This mapping can be
str to str on any platform or bytes to bytes on POSIX platforms much like
`os.environ` or `os.environb`.

> **Note**
>
> If specified, *env* must provide any variables required for the program to
> execute.  On Windows, in order to run a `side-by-side assembly`_ the
> specified *env* **must** include a valid `%SystemRoot%`.

If *encoding* or *errors* are specified, or *text* is true, the file objects
*stdin*, *stdout* and *stderr* are opened in text mode with the specified
*encoding* and *errors*, as described above in `frequently-used-arguments`.
The *universal_newlines* argument is equivalent  to *text* and is provided
for backwards compatibility. By default, file objects are opened in binary mode.

> *Added in 3.6*: *encoding* and *errors* were added.

> *Added in 3.7*: *text* was added as a more readable alias for *universal_newlines*.

If given, *startupinfo* will be a `STARTUPINFO` object, which is
passed to the underlying `CreateProcess` function.

如果给出，*creationflags* 可以是下列旗标中的一个或多个：

* `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`
* `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
* `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`
* `BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`
* `HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS`
* `IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS`
* `NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`
* `REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS`
* `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`
* `DETACHED_PROCESS`
* `CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE`
* `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`

*pipesize* can be used to change the size of the pipe when
`PIPE` is used for *stdin*, *stdout* or *stderr*. The size of the pipe
is only changed on platforms that support this (only Linux at this time of
writing). Other platforms will ignore this parameter.

> *Changed in 3.10*: Added the *pipesize* parameter.

Popen objects are supported as context managers via the `with` statement:
on exit, standard file descriptors are closed, and the process is waited for.
::

   with Popen(["ifconfig"], stdout=PIPE) as proc:
       log.write(proc.stdout.read())

audit-event:: subprocess.Popen executable,args,cwd,env subprocess.Popen

> *Changed in 3.2*: Added context manager support.

> *Changed in 3.6*: Popen destructor now emits a :exc:`ResourceWarning` warning if the child process is still running.

> *Changed in 3.8*: Popen can use :func:`os.posix_spawn` in some cases for better performance. On Windows Subsystem for Linux and QEMU User Emulation, Popen constructor using :func:`os.posix_spawn` no longer raise an exception on errors like missing program, but the child process fails with a non-zero :attr:`~Popen.returncode`.
