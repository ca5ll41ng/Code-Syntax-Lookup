# resolve_name

将一个名称解析为对象。

This functionality is used in numerous places in the standard library (see
`12915`) - and equivalent functionality is also in widely used
third-party packages such as setuptools, Django and Pyramid.

It is expected that *name* will be a string in one of the following
formats, where W is shorthand for a valid Python identifier and dot stands
for a literal period in these pseudo-regexes:

* `W(.W)*`
* `W(.W)*:(W(.W)*)?`
* `W(.W)*:(W(.W)*)`

The first form is intended for backward compatibility only. It assumes that
some part of the dotted name is a package, and the rest is an object
somewhere within that package, possibly nested inside other objects.
Because the place where the package stops and the object hierarchy starts
can't be inferred by inspection, repeated attempts to import must be done
with this form.

In the second form, the caller makes the division point clear through the
provision of a single colon: the dotted name to the left of the colon is a
package to be imported, and the dotted name to the right is the object
hierarchy within that package. Only one import is needed in this form. If
it ends with the colon, then a module object is returned.

The first two forms are accepted when `strict=False` (the default).

The third form requires both the module name and callable, separated by
a colon. Only this form is accepted when `strict=True`.

The function will return an object (which might be a module), or raise one
of the following exceptions:

:exc:`ValueError` -- 如果 *name* 不为可识别的格式。

:exc:`ImportError` -- 如果导入本应成功但却失败。

`AttributeError` -- If a failure occurred when traversing the object
hierarchy within the imported package to get to the desired object.

> *Added in 3.9*

> *Changed in 3.15*: The optional keyword-only ``strict`` flag was added.
