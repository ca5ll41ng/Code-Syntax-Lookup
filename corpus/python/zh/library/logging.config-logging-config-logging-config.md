# Security considerations

**Security considerations**

The logging configuration functionality tries to offer convenience, and in part this
is done by offering the ability to convert text in configuration files into Python
objects used in logging configuration - for example, as described in
`logging-config-dict-userdef`. However, these same mechanisms (importing
callables from user-defined modules and calling them with parameters from the
configuration) could be used to invoke any code you like, and for this reason you
should treat configuration files from untrusted sources with *extreme caution* and
satisfy yourself that nothing bad can happen if you load them, before actually loading
them.

.. _logging-config-dictschema:

**Configuration dictionary schema**

Describing a logging configuration requires listing the various
objects to create and the connections between them; for example, you
may create a handler named 'console' and then say that the logger
named 'startup' will send its messages to the 'console' handler.
These objects aren't limited to those provided by the `logging`
module because you might write your own formatter or handler class.
The parameters to these classes may also need to include external
objects such as `sys.stderr`.  The syntax for describing these
objects and connections is defined in `logging-config-dict-connections`
below.

Dictionary Schema Details
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

The dictionary passed to `dictConfig` must contain the following
keys:

* *version* - to be set to an integer value representing the schema
  version.  The only valid value at present is 1, but having this key
  allows the schema to evolve while still preserving backwards
  compatibility.

All other keys are optional, but if present they will be interpreted
as described below.  In all cases below where a 'configuring dict' is
mentioned, it will be checked for the special `'()'` key to see if a
custom instantiation is required.  If so, the mechanism described in
`logging-config-dict-userdef` below is used to create an instance;
otherwise, the context is used to determine what to instantiate.

.. _logging-config-dictschema-formatters:

* *formatters* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each
  key is a formatter id and each value is a dict describing how to
  configure the corresponding `~logging.Formatter` instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the following optional keys
  which correspond to the arguments passed to create a
  `~logging.Formatter` object:

  * `format`
  * `datefmt`
  * `style`
  * `validate` (since version >=3.8)
  * `defaults` (since version >=3.12)

  An optional `class` key indicates the name of the formatter's
  class (as a dotted module and class name).  The instantiation
  arguments are as for `~logging.Formatter`, thus this key is
  most useful for instantiating a customised subclass of
  `~logging.Formatter`.  For example, the alternative class
  might present exception tracebacks in an expanded or condensed
  format.  If your formatter requires different or extra configuration
  keys, you should use `logging-config-dict-userdef`.

* *filters* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key
  is a filter id and each value is a dict describing how to configure
  the corresponding Filter instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the key `name` (defaulting to the
  empty string) and this is used to construct a `logging.Filter`
  instance.

* *handlers* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each
  key is a handler id and each value is a dict describing how to
  configure the corresponding Handler instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the following keys:

  * `class` (mandatory).  This is the fully qualified name of the
    handler class.

  * `level` (optional).  The level of the handler.

  * `formatter` (optional).  The id of the formatter for this
    handler.

  * `filters` (optional).  A list of ids of the filters for this
    handler.

> *Changed in 3.11*: ``filters`` can take filter instances in addition to ids.

  All *other* keys are passed through as keyword arguments to the
  handler's constructor.  For example, given the snippet:

```yaml

handlers:
  console:
    class : logging.StreamHandler
    formatter: brief
    level   : INFO
    filters: [allow_foo]
    stream  : ext://sys.stdout
  file:
    class : logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
    formatter: precise
    filename: logconfig.log
    maxBytes: 1024
    backupCount: 3
```

  the handler with id `console` is instantiated as a
  `logging.StreamHandler`, using `sys.stdout` as the underlying
  stream.  The handler with id `file` is instantiated as a
  `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` with the keyword arguments
  `filename='logconfig.log', maxBytes=1024, backupCount=3`.

* *loggers* - the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key
  is a logger name and each value is a dict describing how to
  configure the corresponding Logger instance.

  The configuring dict is searched for the following keys:

  * `level` (optional).  The level of the logger.

  * `propagate` (optional).  The propagation setting of the logger.

  * `filters` (optional).  A list of ids of the filters for this
    logger.

> *Changed in 3.11*: ``filters`` can take filter instances in addition to ids.

  * `handlers` (optional).  A list of ids of the handlers for this
    logger.

  The specified loggers will be configured according to the level,
  propagation, filters and handlers specified.

* *root* - this will be the configuration for the root logger.
  Processing of the configuration will be as for any logger, except
  that the `propagate` setting will not be applicable.

* *incremental* - whether the configuration is to be interpreted as
  incremental to the existing configuration.  This value defaults to
  `False`, which means that the specified configuration replaces the
  existing configuration with the same semantics as used by the
  existing `fileConfig` API.

  If the specified value is `True`, the configuration is processed
  as described in the section on `logging-config-dict-incremental`.

* *disable_existing_loggers* - whether any existing non-root loggers are
  to be disabled. This setting mirrors the parameter of the same name in
  `fileConfig`. If absent, this parameter defaults to `True`.
  This value is ignored if *incremental* is `True`.

.. _logging-config-dict-incremental:

Incremental Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

It is difficult to provide complete flexibility for incremental
configuration.  For example, because objects such as filters
and formatters are anonymous, once a configuration is set up, it is
not possible to refer to such anonymous objects when augmenting a
configuration.

Furthermore, there is not a compelling case for arbitrarily altering
the object graph of loggers, handlers, filters, formatters at
run-time, once a configuration is set up; the verbosity of loggers and
handlers can be controlled just by setting levels (and, in the case of
loggers, propagation flags).  Changing the object graph arbitrarily in
a safe way is problematic in a multi-threaded environment; while not
impossible, the benefits are not worth the complexity it adds to the
implementation.

Thus, when the `incremental` key of a configuration dict is present
and is `True`, the system will completely ignore any `formatters` and
`filters` entries, and process only the `level`
settings in the `handlers` entries, and the `level` and
`propagate` settings in the `loggers` and `root` entries.

Using a value in the configuration dict lets configurations to be sent
over the wire as pickled dicts to a socket listener. Thus, the logging
verbosity of a long-running application can be altered over time with
no need to stop and restart the application.

.. _logging-config-dict-connections:

Object connections
""""""""""""""""""

The schema describes a set of logging objects - loggers,
handlers, formatters, filters - which are connected to each other in
an object graph.  Thus, the schema needs to represent connections
between the objects.  For example, say that, once configured, a
particular logger has attached to it a particular handler.  For the
purposes of this discussion, we can say that the logger represents the
source, and the handler the destination, of a connection between the
two.  Of course in the configured objects this is represented by the
logger holding a reference to the handler.  In the configuration dict,
this is done by giving each destination object an id which identifies
it unambiguously, and then using the id in the source object's
configuration to indicate that a connection exists between the source
and the destination object with that id.

因此，举例来说，考虑以下 YAML 代码段:

```yaml

formatters:
  brief:
    # configuration for formatter with id 'brief' goes here
  precise:
    # configuration for formatter with id 'precise' goes here
handlers:
  h1: #This is an id
   # configuration of handler with id 'h1' goes here
   formatter: brief
  h2: #This is another id
   # configuration of handler with id 'h2' goes here
   formatter: precise
loggers:
  foo.bar.baz:
    # other configuration for logger 'foo.bar.baz'
    handlers: [h1, h2]
```

(Note: YAML used here because it's a little more readable than the
equivalent Python source form for the dictionary.)

The ids for loggers are the logger names which would be used
programmatically to obtain a reference to those loggers, e.g.
`foo.bar.baz`.  The ids for Formatters and Filters can be any string
value (such as `brief`, `precise` above) and they are transient,
in that they are only meaningful for processing the configuration
dictionary and used to determine connections between objects, and are
not persisted anywhere when the configuration call is complete.

The above snippet indicates that logger named `foo.bar.baz` should
have two handlers attached to it, which are described by the handler
ids `h1` and `h2`. The formatter for `h1` is that described by id
`brief`, and the formatter for `h2` is that described by id
`precise`.

.. _logging-config-dict-userdef:

User-defined objects
""""""""""""""""""""

The schema supports user-defined objects for handlers, filters and
formatters.  (Loggers do not need to have different types for
different instances, so there is no support in this configuration
schema for user-defined logger classes.)

Objects to be configured are described by dictionaries
which detail their configuration.  In some places, the logging system
will be able to infer from the context how an object is to be
instantiated, but when a user-defined object is to be instantiated,
the system will not know how to do this.  In order to provide complete
flexibility for user-defined object instantiation, the user needs
to provide a 'factory' - a callable which is called with a
configuration dictionary and which returns the instantiated object.
This is signalled by an absolute import path to the factory being
made available under the special key `'()'`.  Here's a concrete
example:

```yaml

formatters:
  brief:
    format: '%(message)s'
  default:
    format: '%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(name)-15s %(message)s'
    datefmt: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
  custom:
      (): my.package.customFormatterFactory
      bar: baz
      spam: 99.9
      answer: 42
```

The above YAML snippet defines three formatters.  The first, with id
`brief`, is a standard `logging.Formatter` instance with the
specified format string.  The second, with id `default`, has a
longer format and also defines the time format explicitly, and will
result in a `logging.Formatter` initialized with those two format
strings.  Shown in Python source form, the `brief` and `default`
formatters have configuration sub-dictionaries::

    {
      'format' : '%(message)s'
    }

和::

    {
      'format' : '%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(name)-15s %(message)s',
      'datefmt' : '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
    }

respectively, and as these dictionaries do not contain the special key
`'()'`, the instantiation is inferred from the context: as a result,
standard `logging.Formatter` instances are created.  The
configuration sub-dictionary for the third formatter, with id
`custom`, is::

  {
    '()' : 'my.package.customFormatterFactory',
    'bar' : 'baz',
    'spam' : 99.9,
    'answer' : 42
  }

and this contains the special key `'()'`, which means that
user-defined instantiation is wanted.  In this case, the specified
factory callable will be used. If it is an actual callable it will be
used directly - otherwise, if you specify a string (as in the example)
the actual callable will be located using normal import mechanisms.
The callable will be called with the **remaining** items in the
configuration sub-dictionary as keyword arguments.  In the above
example, the formatter with id `custom` will be assumed to be
returned by the call::

    my.package.customFormatterFactory(bar='baz', spam=99.9, answer=42)

> **Warning**
>
> the above example should not be configuration dictionaries or references such
> as `cfg://foo` or `ext://bar`, because they will not be processed by the
> configuration machinery, but passed to the callable as-is.
>

The key `'()'` has been used as the special key because it is not a
valid keyword parameter name, and so will not clash with the names of
the keyword arguments used in the call.  The `'()'` also serves as a
mnemonic that the corresponding value is a callable.

> *Changed in 3.11*: The ``filters`` member of ``handlers`` and ``loggers`` can take filter instances in addition to ids.

You can also specify a special key `'.'` whose value is a
mapping of attribute names to values. If found, the specified attributes will
be set on the user-defined object before it is returned. Thus, with the
following configuration::

    {
      '()' : 'my.package.customFormatterFactory',
      'bar' : 'baz',
      'spam' : 99.9,
      'answer' : 42,
      '.' : {
        'foo': 'bar',
        'baz': 'bozz'
      }
    }

the returned formatter will have attribute `foo` set to `'bar'` and
attribute `baz` set to `'bozz'`.

> **Warning**
>
> the above example should not be configuration dictionaries or references such
> as `cfg://foo` or `ext://bar`, because they will not be processed by the
> configuration machinery, but set as attribute values as-is.
>

.. _handler-config-dict-order:

Handler configuration order
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Handlers are configured in alphabetical order of their keys, and a configured
handler replaces the configuration dictionary in (a working copy of) the
`handlers` dictionary in the schema. If you use a construct such as
`cfg://handlers.foo`, then initially `handlers['foo']` points to the
configuration dictionary for the handler named `foo`, and later (once that
handler has been configured) it points to the configured handler instance.
Thus, `cfg://handlers.foo` could resolve to either a dictionary or a handler
instance. In general, it is wise to name handlers in a way such that dependent
handlers are configured *after* any handlers they depend on; that allows
something like `cfg://handlers.foo` to be used in configuring a handler that
depends on handler `foo`. If that dependent handler were named `bar`,
problems would result, because the configuration of `bar` would be attempted
before that of `foo`, and `foo` would not yet have been configured.
However, if the dependent handler were named `foobar`, it would be configured
after `foo`, with the result that `cfg://handlers.foo` would resolve to
configured handler `foo`, and not its configuration dictionary.

.. _logging-config-dict-externalobj:

Access to external objects
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There are times where a configuration needs to refer to objects
external to the configuration, for example `sys.stderr`.  If the
configuration dict is constructed using Python code, this is
straightforward, but a problem arises when the configuration is
provided via a text file (e.g. JSON, YAML).  In a text file, there is
no standard way to distinguish `sys.stderr` from the literal string
`'sys.stderr'`.  To facilitate this distinction, the configuration
system looks for certain special prefixes in string values and
treat them specially.  For example, if the literal string
`'ext://sys.stderr'` is provided as a value in the configuration,
then the `ext://` will be stripped off and the remainder of the
value processed using normal import mechanisms.

The handling of such prefixes is done in a way analogous to protocol
handling: there is a generic mechanism to look for prefixes which
match the regular expression `^(?P<prefix>[a-z]+)://(?P<suffix>.*)$`
whereby, if the `prefix` is recognised, the `suffix` is processed
in a prefix-dependent manner and the result of the processing replaces
the string value.  If the prefix is not recognised, then the string
value will be left as-is.

.. _logging-config-dict-internalobj:

Access to internal objects
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As well as external objects, there is sometimes also a need to refer
to objects in the configuration.  This will be done implicitly by the
configuration system for things that it knows about.  For example, the
string value `'DEBUG'` for a `level` in a logger or handler will
automatically be converted to the value `logging.DEBUG`, and the
`handlers`, `filters` and `formatter` entries will take an
object id and resolve to the appropriate destination object.

However, a more generic mechanism is needed for user-defined
objects which are not known to the `logging` module.  For
example, consider `logging.handlers.MemoryHandler`, which takes
a `target` argument which is another handler to delegate to. Since
the system already knows about this class, then in the configuration,
the given `target` just needs to be the object id of the relevant
target handler, and the system will resolve to the handler from the
id.  If, however, a user defines a `my.package.MyHandler` which has
an `alternate` handler, the configuration system would not know that
the `alternate` referred to a handler.  To cater for this, a generic
resolution system allows the user to specify:

```yaml

handlers:
  file:
    # configuration of file handler goes here

  custom:
    (): my.package.MyHandler
    alternate: cfg://handlers.file
```

The literal string `'cfg://handlers.file'` will be resolved in an
analogous way to strings with the `ext://` prefix, but looking
in the configuration itself rather than the import namespace.  The
mechanism allows access by dot or by index, in a similar way to
that provided by `str.format`.  Thus, given the following snippet:

```yaml

handlers:
  email:
    class: logging.handlers.SMTPHandler
    mailhost: localhost
    fromaddr: my_app@domain.tld
    toaddrs:
      - support_team@domain.tld
      - dev_team@domain.tld
    subject: Houston, we have a problem.
```

in the configuration, the string `'cfg://handlers'` would resolve to
the dict with key `handlers`, the string `'cfg://handlers.email`
would resolve to the dict with key `email` in the `handlers` dict,
and so on.  The string `'cfg://handlers.email.toaddrs[1]` would
resolve to `'dev_team@domain.tld'` and the string
`'cfg://handlers.email.toaddrs[0]'` would resolve to the value
`'support_team@domain.tld'`. The `subject` value could be accessed
using either `'cfg://handlers.email.subject'` or, equivalently,
`'cfg://handlers.email[subject]'`.  The latter form only needs to be
used if the key contains spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. Please note
that the characters `[` and `]` are not allowed in the keys. If an
index value consists only of decimal digits, access will be attempted
using the corresponding integer value, falling back to the string
value if needed.

Given a string `cfg://handlers.myhandler.mykey.123`, this will
resolve to `config_dict['handlers']['myhandler']['mykey']['123']`.
If the string is specified as `cfg://handlers.myhandler.mykey[123]`,
the system will attempt to retrieve the value from
`config_dict['handlers']['myhandler']['mykey'][123]`, and fall back
to `config_dict['handlers']['myhandler']['mykey']['123']` if that
fails.

.. _logging-import-resolution:

Import resolution and custom importers
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Import resolution, by default, uses the builtin `__import__` function
to do its importing. You may want to replace this with your own importing
mechanism: if so, you can replace the `importer` attribute of the
`DictConfigurator` or its superclass, the
`BaseConfigurator` class. However, you need to be
careful because of the way functions are accessed from classes via
descriptors. If you are using a Python callable to do your imports, and you
want to define it at class level rather than instance level, you need to wrap
it with `staticmethod`. For example::

   from importlib import import_module
   from logging.config import BaseConfigurator

   BaseConfigurator.importer = staticmethod(import_module)

You don't need to wrap with `staticmethod` if you're setting the import
callable on a configurator *instance*.

.. _configure-queue:

Configuring QueueHandler and QueueListener
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to configure a `~logging.handlers.QueueHandler`, noting that this
is normally used in conjunction with a `~logging.handlers.QueueListener`, you
can configure both together. After the configuration, the `QueueListener` instance
will be available as the `~logging.handlers.QueueHandler.listener` attribute of
the created handler, and that in turn will be available to you using
`~logging.getHandlerByName` and passing the name you have used for the
`QueueHandler` in your configuration. The dictionary schema for configuring the pair
is shown in the example YAML snippet below.

```yaml

handlers:
  qhand:
    class: logging.handlers.QueueHandler
    queue: my.module.queue_factory
    listener: my.package.CustomListener
    handlers:
      - hand_name_1
      - hand_name_2
      ...
```

``queue`` 和 ``listener`` 键是可选的。

如果存在 ``queue`` 键，相应的值可以是下列几项之一:

* An object implementing the `Queue.put_nowait`
  and `Queue.get` public API. For instance, this may be
  an actual instance of `queue.Queue` or a subclass thereof, or a proxy
  obtained by `multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.Queue`.

  This is of course only possible if you are constructing or modifying
  the configuration dictionary in code.

* A string that resolves to a callable which, when called with no arguments, returns
  the queue instance to use. That callable could be a `queue.Queue` subclass
  or a function which returns a suitable queue instance,
  such as `my.module.queue_factory()`.

* A dict with a `'()'` key which is constructed in the usual way as discussed in
  `logging-config-dict-userdef`. The result of this construction should be a
  `queue.Queue` instance.

If the  `queue` key is absent, a standard unbounded `queue.Queue` instance is
created and used.

如果存在 ``listener`` 键，则相应的值可以是下列几项中的一个:

* A subclass of `logging.handlers.QueueListener`. This is of course only
  possible if you are constructing or modifying the configuration dictionary in
  code.

* A string which resolves to a class which is a subclass of `QueueListener`, such as
  `'my.package.CustomListener'`.

* A dict with a `'()'` key which is constructed in the usual way as discussed in
  `logging-config-dict-userdef`. The result of this construction should be a
  callable with the same signature as the `QueueListener` initializer.

如果不存在 ``listener`` 键，则会使用 :class:`logging.handlers.QueueListener`。

The values under the `handlers` key are the names of other handlers in the
configuration (not shown in the above snippet) which will be passed to the queue
listener.

Any custom queue handler and listener classes will need to be defined with the same
initialization signatures as `~logging.handlers.QueueHandler` and
`~logging.handlers.QueueListener`.

> *Added in 3.12*

.. _logging-config-fileformat:

**Configuration file format**

The configuration file format understood by `fileConfig` is based on
`configparser` functionality. The file must contain sections called
`[loggers]`, `[handlers]` and `[formatters]` which identify by name the
entities of each type which are defined in the file. For each such entity, there
is a separate section which identifies how that entity is configured.  Thus, for
a logger named `log01` in the `[loggers]` section, the relevant
configuration details are held in a section `[logger_log01]`. Similarly, a
handler called `hand01` in the `[handlers]` section will have its
configuration held in a section called `[handler_hand01]`, while a formatter
called `form01` in the `[formatters]` section will have its configuration
specified in a section called `[formatter_form01]`. The root logger
configuration must be specified in a section called `[logger_root]`.

> **Note**
>
> The `fileConfig` API is older than the `dictConfig` API and does
> not provide functionality to cover certain aspects of logging. For example,
> you cannot configure `~logging.Filter` objects, which provide for
> filtering of messages beyond simple integer levels, using `fileConfig`.
> If you need to have instances of `~logging.Filter` in your logging

在文件中这些小节的例子如下所示。

```ini

[loggers]
keys=root,log02,log03,log04,log05,log06,log07

[handlers]
keys=hand01,hand02,hand03,hand04,hand05,hand06,hand07,hand08,hand09

[formatters]
keys=form01,form02,form03,form04,form05,form06,form07,form08,form09
```

The root logger must specify a level and a list of handlers. An example of a
root logger section is given below.

```ini

[logger_root]
level=NOTSET
handlers=hand01
```

The `level` entry can be one of `DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL` or
`NOTSET`. For the root logger only, `NOTSET` means that all messages will be
logged. Level values are `evaluated` in the context of the `logging`
package's namespace.

The `handlers` entry is a comma-separated list of handler names, which must
appear in the `[handlers]` section. These names must appear in the
`[handlers]` section and have corresponding sections in the configuration
file.

For loggers other than the root logger, some additional information is required.
This is illustrated by the following example.

```ini

[logger_parser]
level=DEBUG
handlers=hand01
propagate=1
qualname=compiler.parser
```

The `level` and `handlers` entries are interpreted as for the root logger,
except that if a non-root logger's level is specified as `NOTSET`, the system
consults loggers higher up the hierarchy to determine the effective level of the
logger. The `propagate` entry is set to 1 to indicate that messages must
propagate to handlers higher up the logger hierarchy from this logger, or 0 to
indicate that messages are **not** propagated to handlers up the hierarchy. The
`qualname` entry is the hierarchical channel name of the logger, that is to
say the name used by the application to get the logger.

指定处理器配置的小节说明如下。

```ini

[handler_hand01]
class=StreamHandler
level=NOTSET
formatter=form01
args=(sys.stdout,)
```

The `class` entry indicates the handler's class (as determined by `eval`
in the `logging` package's namespace). The `level` is interpreted as for
loggers, and `NOTSET` is taken to mean 'log everything'.

The `formatter` entry indicates the key name of the formatter for this
handler. If blank, a default formatter (`logging._defaultFormatter`) is used.
If a name is specified, it must appear in the `[formatters]` section and have
a corresponding section in the configuration file.

The `args` entry, when `evaluated` in the context of the `logging`
package's namespace, is the list of arguments to the constructor for the handler
class. Refer to the constructors for the relevant handlers, or to the examples
below, to see how typical entries are constructed. If not provided, it defaults
to `()`.

The optional `kwargs` entry, when `evaluated` in the context of the
`logging` package's namespace, is the keyword argument dict to the constructor
for the handler class. If not provided, it defaults to `{}`.

```ini

[handler_hand02]
class=FileHandler
level=DEBUG
formatter=form02
args=('python.log', 'w')

[handler_hand03]

指定格式化器配置的小节说明如下。

```ini

[formatter_form01]
format=F1 %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s %(customfield)s
datefmt=
style=%
validate=True
defaults={'customfield': 'defaultvalue'}
class=logging.Formatter
```

The arguments for the formatter configuration are the same as the keys
in the dictionary schema `formatters section`.

The `defaults` entry, when `evaluated` in the context of
the `logging` package's namespace, is a dictionary of default values for
custom formatting fields. If not provided, it defaults to `None`.

> multiple users with no mutual trust run code on the same machine; see the
> `listen` documentation for more information.
